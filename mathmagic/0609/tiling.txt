THEOREM 
 ~~~~~~~ 
 A rectangle can be tiled with (axa) and (bxb) squares, Ê iff 
 

(i) gcd(a,b)=1 , and any of the following hold: 
 

either: Êboth sides of the rectangle are multiples of a; 
 Ê Ê or: Êboth sides of the rectangle are multiples of b; 
 Ê Ê or: Êone side is a multiple of (ab), and the other is any length EXCEPT 
 Ê Ê Ê Ê Êone of a finite number of "bad" lengths: those numbers which are 
 Ê Ê Ê Ê ÊNOT positive integer combinations of a & b. { By Sylvester's theorem 
 Ê Ê Ê Ê Êthere are (a-1)(b-1)/2 of these, the largest being (a-1)(b-1)-1. } 
 

(ii) gcd(a,b) = d . 
 Ê Ê ÊThen merely apply (i) to the problem with a,b replaced 
 Ê Ê Êby a/d, b/d Êand the rectangle lengths also divided by d. 
 Ê Ê Êi.e. Êall cells must appear in (dxd) subsquares. 
 

------ 
 PROOF 
 It is clear that (ii) follows from (i), and that simple constructions give 
 the "if" part of (i). For the "only if" part, we prove that... 
 

(S) If one side of the rectangle is not divisible by a, and the other is 
 Ê Ê not divisible by b, then the tiling is impossible. 
 

The results in (i) follow immediately from (S). 
 

To prove (S): Ê( Chakraborty-Hoey style ). 
 Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 Let the width of the rectangle be a NON-(a-multiple). Then the number of 
 bxb squares starting (i.e. top edge) at row 1 must be a NON-a-multiple. 
 Thus the number of bxb starting at row 2 must BE an a-multiple. Similarly 
 for the number starting at rows 3,4,...,b . Then the number starting at 
 row (b+1) must be a NON-a-multiple again. 
 

Similarly the number starting at rows (2b+1), (3b+1), (4b+1),... must all be 
 non-a-multiples. So if the number of rows is NOT a multiple of b, (call it 
 bx+r), then row (bx+1) must have a NON-a-multiple of bxb squares starting 
 there, i.e. at least one, and there is no room left to squeeze it in. Ê Ê [QED]

A Rickard-style proof of (S) is Ê Ê..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW ...W(..etc) 
 Ê ~~~~~~~ Ê also possible, by Ê Ê Ê..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW ...W 
 coloring the rectangle in Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW ...W 
 vertical strips as shown here: Ê Ê Ê <- Êa Ê->< b-a ><- Êa Ê->< b-a > 
 

Every square tile covers an a-multiple of black squares. But if the width 
 is a NON-b-multiple, and the number of rows is a NON-a-multiple, then there 
 are a NON-a-multiple of black squares in total. Ê Ê[QED] 
 

(Note: the coloring must have 1 column of blacks on the right, and any 
 Ê==== Ê Ê spare columns of whites on the left.)
