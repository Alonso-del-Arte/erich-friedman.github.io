Previous months have featured problems involving tiling strips of consecutive squares (<a href="1201.html">December 2001</a>) and L's made out of consecutive squares (<a href="0402.html">April 2002</a>).  This month we are interested in tiling U's made out of consecutive squares into rectangles.  For example, non-degenerate U's made of squares of size 1 through 4 can be made into these 3 different rectangles:<p>

Are these the only such tilings for 4 U's (aside from extending these vertically by 12k units)?  Can you prove that there are no tilings for n=2 and n=3?  What are the U tilings for n=5?  How about larger n?<p>

What is the smallest n for which the first n U's can tile a square?  I'll offer a prize of $10 to the smallest square tiled with consecutive U's by the end of the month, with ties going to the first one received.

Joseph DeVincentis explained why no 2 U or 3 U tiling exists.<p>

Joseph DeVincentis and Philippe Fondanaiche found another 4 U tiling:<p>

Joseph DeVincentis and Jeremy Galvagni found this 5 U tiling:<p>

Berend Jan van der Zwaag found these two 5 U tilings:<p>

Joseph DeVincentis found 4 trivial 5 U tilings made by wrapping an extended 4 U tiling with a width 5 U.<p>

Joseph DeVincentis also found a U tiling of a 36&times;36 square using L's of sizes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.  This isn't quite what i was looking for, but I sent him $10 anyway.<p>
