In graph theory, this question can be rephrased: What is the maximum number of edges an n-vertex graph can have so that the resulting graph contains no 4-cycle?<p>If we let <b>E(n)</b> denote the maximum number of edges for n vertices, how does E(n) grow?  In particular, what is the limiting value of E(n) / n<sup>2</sup> as n &rarr; &infin;?

<P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>Ulrich Schimke proved that E(n) is strictly monotone. This is clear since if you add a vertex, you can always add at least one edge to that vertex without creating a 4-cycle.<p>Ulrich Schimke also defined a class of graphs with this property.  If S is a set of positive integers, let <b>G(S,n)</b> be the graph with vertices numbered 0 through n&ndash;1, and edges between all vertices k and sk, for s in S.  Thus G({1,2},5) is the graph with 5 vertices above.  He notes that if S={1,2,7,22,67,...} in which each term in the sequence is one more than 3 times the previous term, then G(S,n) has the desired property.<p>Ulrich Schimke also showed that for every n, there exists a k with E(kn) &ge; k E(n) + kn.  He accomplishes this by taking k copies of the graph with n vertices and E(n) edges, and connecting them in a cycle in a way that creates no new 4-cycles.  He uses this to construct a sequence a(n) so that E(a(n))/a(n) &rarr; &infin;.  Since E(n) is super-additive, E(n+m) &ge; E(n)+E(m), we know E(n)/n has a limit, and therefore this limit is infinite.<p>Trevor Green proved that E(n) &le; n E(n-1)/(n-2).  His proof: Consider D(n) = n(n&ndash;1)/2 &ndash; E(n), the number of edges we must delete from K<sub>n</sub> to get a graph with no 4-cycles.  Now let's consider K<sub>n</sub>.  If we delete one vertex from it, we are left with K<sub>n&ndash;1</sub>, so we must delete D(n&ndash;1) of the remaining edges to have no 4-cycles.  There are n ways to delete one vertex, so (counting multiple deletions) we must delete n D(n-1) edges from K<sub>n</sub>.  But every edge in K<sub>n</sub> is in (n&ndash;2) of these copies of K<sub>n-1</sub>, so in K<sub>n</sub>, we have to delete at least n D(n&ndash;1)/(n&ndash;2) edges.  So D(n) &ge; n D(n&ndash;1)/(n&ndash;2).  When we substitute our formula for E(n) into this inequality, we get the result.<p>Philippe Fondanaiche conjectures that E(n) grows like n ln n.<p>Tetsuji Nishikura showed that E(n) &ge; <img src="lfloor.gif" align=abscenter>3(n-1)/2<img src="rfloor.gif" align=abscenter> by connecting a bunch of triangles.<p>Joseph DeVincentis found the best known values for E(n) for n &le; 15.  These values are in the table below.  Philippe Fondanaiche conjectured some values for n &gt; 15.<p><p><CENTER><H2>Maximum Number of Edges in a Graph with n Vertices and No 4-Cycle</H2></CENTER><center><table bgcolor="FFFFCF" cellpadding=2 border=1><tr align=center><th bgcolor=lightgreen>n<td>1<td>2<td>3<td>4<td>5<td>6<td>7<td>8<td>9<td>10<td>11<td>12<td>13<td>14<td>15<td>16<td>17<td>18<td>19<td>20<td>21<td>22</tr><tr align=center><th bgcolor=lightgreen>E(n)<td>0<td>1<td>3<td>4<td>6<td>7<td>9<td>11<td>13<td>16<td>18<td>21<td>24<td>27<td>30<td>33<td>36<td>39<td>42<td>46<td>50<td>52</tr></table></center><p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="1000/g3.gif"><td><img src="1000/g4.gif"><td><img src="1000/g5.gif"><td><img src="1000/g6.gif"><td><img src="1000/g7.gif"></tr></table></center><p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="1000/g8.gif"><td><img src="1000/g9.gif"><td><img src="1000/g10.gif"><td><img src="1000/g11.gif"><td><img src="1000/g12.gif"></tr></table></center><p>Olexandr Ravsky proved that E(n) = n<sup>3/2</sup>/2 (1+O(1/ln n)).  Here is his short paper in <a href="1000/4cycles.ps">postscript</a>.  He says that this bound has been known since the 1960's.  In 1996, Furedi computed E(n) exactly for all numbers n=q<sup>2</sup>+q+1, where q is a prime power greater than 13.<p>Alexander Engstrom corrected the values of E(13) and E(14) and pointed out sequence <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi?Anum=006855">A006855</a> of the <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/index.html">Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</A>.<p><HR><p>If you can extend any of these results, please <a href="mailto:erichfriedman68@gmail.com">e-mail</a> me.  Click <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/">here</a> to go back to Math Magic.  <font size=-1>Last updated 5/26/03.<font></BODY></HTML>
