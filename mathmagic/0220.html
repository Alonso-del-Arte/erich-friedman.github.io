<CENTER><H1>Problem of the Month (February 2020)</H1></CENTER>

The problem used for Problem #1283 of the <a href="http://stanwagon.com/potw/">Macalester College Problem of the Week</a> at my suggestion was the case K=4, N=8 of the following problem: Suppose K players enter a tournament, that the players are strictly ordered in ability, and that the better player wins 2/3 of the games.  How should one construct a tournament of N games in series to maximize the chance of the best player winning the tournament.  The answers are surprising, and can be found below.<p>

This month's problem is to generalize this further.  What if the tournament's purpose is not just to specify a winner, but to order all the players in ability.  What tournament maximizes the probability that we are correct?<p>

For example, if there are K=3 players and N=2 games, the best we can do is A vs B and (regardless of who wins the first time) A vs C, and then to guess an ordering that is consistent with those results.  1/3 of the time, A will be the middle player in ability, and then we will guess correctly if both games are accurate.  2/3 of the time, A will be the best or worst player, and then will guess half the time both games are accurate.  So we will succeed with probability (1/3)(2/3)<sup>2</sup>+(2/3)(1/2)(2/3)<sup>2</sup>=8/27.

<P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>

Here are the best known results for the generalization.  Unless otherwise, stated, you should guess an ordering which is consistent with all the pairwise results.<p>
