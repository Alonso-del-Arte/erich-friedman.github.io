We'll consider linearcombinations of form $\sum_i a_i \sqrt{b_i}$, where $a_i \in\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\} $. We want count number of such linearcombinations such that \begin{equation} \label{eqno1} \sum_i a_ib_i \leq n \end{equation}.We know that number of square-free numbers up to $x$ is$A(x)=\frac{6}{\pi^2}x+o\left(x^{1/2}\right)$ (there are strongererror bounds known; the best known to me is$O\left(x^{7/22}\right)$ assuming Riemann hypothesis, and$O\left(x^{1/2}e^{-A \log^{3/5} x \log \log^{-1/5} x}\right)$without using any unproved hypothesis, but I don't care way toomuch about error term, so I'll use the error term which is easy towrite down). Since$i=A(b_i)=\frac{6}{\pi^2}b_i+o\left(b_i^{1/2}\right)$, we get$b_i=\frac{\pi^2}{6}i+o\left(i^{1/2}\right)$. Substituting it into(\ref{eqno1}) gives\begin{eqnarray} \sum_i a_i\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6}i+o\left(i^{1/2}\right) \right) &\leq& n \\\label{eqno3} \sum_i a_i i + o\left(\sum_i a_i i^{1/2}\right)&\leq& \frac{6}{\pi^2}n\end{eqnarray}Now I claim the left side (without error term) is a partition ofsome number less than $\frac{6}{\pi^2} n$. We know that number ofpartitions of $t$ is asymptotically $\frac{1}{4t \sqrt{3}} e^{\pi\sqrt{2t/3}}$. So, there are asymptotically $\frac{1}{4\frac{6}{\pi^2}n \sqrt{3}} e^{\pi \sqrt{2 \frac{6}{\pi^2}n /3}}=\frac{\pi^2} {24 n \sqrt{3}} e^{2 \sqrt{n}}$ partitions of$\frac{6}{\pi^2} n$. Now, we need to prove that error term in(\ref{eqno3}) is too small to affect our estimate significantly.We'll call error term ``bad`` if it is more than $\varepsilon n$.For bad error term we have\[\varepsilon n < \sum_i a_i i^{1/2}\leq \sum_{i<t} a_i i^{1/2} + t^{-1/2} \sum_{i>t} a_i i=t^{-1/2} n+ \sum_{i<t} a_i i^{1/2} , \] or\[ \left( \varepsilon - t^{-1/2} \right) n < \sum_{i<t} a_i i^{1/2} \leq \sum_{i<t} a_i i\]Now, I have to do  a little bit of hand-waving (which willhopefully be replaced by something rigorous soon). According toTheorem 2.1 from \\Bert Fristedt. The Structure of Random Partitions of LargeIntegers, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol.337, p. 703 \\We know that $a_i i$ is of order $\frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi}$ foralmost all partitions. Setting $t=2\varepsilon^{-2}$, we get thedesired result for sufficiently large $n$.So, I have not proved the desired result, but it should bepossible to prove $\sum_i a_i\sqrt{i}$ is almost always muchsmaller than $\sum_i a_i i$. In worst case, I'll just go back tomy old technique of bounding $a_i$ which imply this statement, butwhich will worsen the constant in exponent.At most $n$ linear combinations have the same value modulo $1$because two linear combinations can have the same value modulo $1$only if they have different number of ones in them (otherwise, wesubtract one linear combination from another, and obtainnon-trivial representation of a integer, which is impossible dueto rational independence). So, by Dirichlet's principle there aretwo of them which differ by less than $\frac{24 n^2\sqrt{3}}{\pi^2} e^{-2 \sqrt{n}}$ modulo $1$. We subtract thosetwo one from another, and add/subtract enough ones, and we getupper bound\[ e^{-2 \sqrt{n} + o(n^{1/2})} \]\end{document}
