This month we are concerned with <b>linear polyominoes</b>, those polyominoes with the property that a line can be drawn that intersects the interior of every square in the polyomino.  For example, there are 8 linear hexominoes:<center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="0301/6r.gif"><td><td><img src="0301/33r.gif"><td><td><img src="0301/222r.gif"></tr></table></center><p><center><table cellpadding=5><tr><td><img src="0301/42r.gif"><td><td><img src="0301/51r.gif"><td><td><img src="0301/231r.gif"><td><td><img src="0301/141r.gif"><td><td><img src="0301/321r.gif"></tr></table></center><p>Notice that the top three polyominoes are <b>special</b> since a line between two of the corners of the polyomino intersects every square, and the bottom 5 polyominoes are <b>not special</b>.  How many linear n-ominoes are there?  How many are special?  What about in higher dimensions?  What is the smallest value of n for which the linear n-ominoes pack into into a rectangle?  How about linear polyhexes and polyiamonds?<P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>Joseph DeVincentis, Trevor Green, and Philippe Fondanaiche found that the number of special linear n-ominoes is equal to the number of relatively-prime non-ordered pairs of positive integers that add to n+1, namely &phi;(n+1)/2, where &phi; is Euler's totient function.  They note that this is sequence <A HREF="http://oeis.org/search?q=A023022">A023022</A> of the <A HREF="http://oeis.org/">Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</A>.  <p>Here is the number of linear n-ominoes, furnished by Joseph DeVincentis and Philippe Fondanaiche:<p><p><CENTER><H2>Number of Linear n-ominoes</H2></CENTER><center><table bgcolor="FFFFCF" cellpadding=5 border=1><tr align=center><th bgcolor=lightgreen>n<td>1<td>2<td>3<td>4<td>5<td>6<td>7<td>8<td>9<td>10<td>11<td>12</tr><tr align=center><th bgcolor=lightgreen>LP(n)<td>1<td>1<td>2<td>3<td>5<td>8<td>11<td>17<td>22<td>31<td>38<td>52</tr></table></center><p>Trevor Green defines a linear polyomino to be <b>semi-special</b> if its line can be drawn through one of the corners of the polyomino.  He then notes that almost all semi-special linear polyominoes correspond to rational numbers of the form a/b, with a+b&le;n, a&le;b and gcd(a,b)=1.  The correspondence is that the slopes of the lines is a/b&ndash;&epsilon;, for some small &epsilon;.  Unfortunately, some pairs of rational numbers yield rotations of the same linear polyomino when n&le;7.<p>

In 2012, Trevor Green found the following formula that counts semi-special linear n-ominoes:<p>

<center>S(n) = 1 + 1/2 [&phi;(3) + &phi;(4) + ... + &phi;(n+1)] &ndash; <img src="lfloor.gif" align=center>n/2<img src="rfloor.gif" align=center></center><p>Mike Reid thinks he can show that the only sets of linear n-ominoes that can tile a rectangle are the trivial sets n=1 and n=2.<p>Joseph DeVincentis found that in higher dimensions, the projections of any linear polyomino are linear polyominoes, and the projections of a special linear polyomino are special linear polyominoes.  As a result, all of the dimensions of the box must be pairwise relatively prime.  The smallest nontrivial one of these is the one inside the 2&times;3&times;5 box.<p><HR><p>If you can extend any of these results, please <a href="mailto:erichfriedman68@gmail.com">e-mail</a> me.  Click <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/">here</a> to go back to Math Magic.  <font size=-1>Last updated 10/24/12.<font></BODY></HTML>
