<pre>movement rule: right-else-left-else-stop               =========================note that the starting position of this robot is sideways in the deadend, otherwise it can't get out.with (i,j)||j meaning the robot is in (i,j) parallel to the j-axis,the only possible single-step movements in this scenario are   from (i,j)||j to (i+/-1,j)||i and   from (i,j)||i to (i,j+/-1)||j.so, the only possible multi-step movements are   from (i,j)||j to (i+2n-1,j+2m)||i or to (i+2n,j+2m)||j; and   from (i,j)||i to (i+2n-1,j+2m)||j or to (i+2n,j+2m)||i.from this we see that the robot can't return to the dead end where itstarted from, because if it's aligned parallel to the j-axis at thestart, it would have to finish in the same dead end parallel to thei-axis (otherwise it can't get in) which is impossible according tothe above movement possiblities.so, the permutations (1)(...) cannot be realized.now suppose the robot finished in some dead end at (i,j)||i, then inorder to start its next trip, it is rotated 90 degrees to (i,j)||j soit can leave from the dead end. so, we get the following possiblemovements from a position in trip k to a position in trip k+1:   from (i,j)||j to (i+2n-1,j+2m)||j or to (i+2n,j+2m)||i; and   from (i,j)||i to (i+2n-1,j+2m)||i or to (i+2n,j+2m)||j.now the robot might be able to finish in the dead end where it startedtrip k. extending this, we see that permutations (123..2n+1)(...)cannot be realized, but that permutations (123..2n)(...) might berealized.permutation      no indoor walls           indoor walls allowed-----------      ---------------           --------------------(1)(...)         not possible              not possible(123)(...)(12345)(...)etc.                 1_ _2(12)             |_ _|                     same                    _4(1234)           1_| |_                    same                 |_   _|                   |_| 3                   2                    _1(12)(34)         2_| |_ _4                 same                 |_ _   _|                     |_|                     3                                             6_ _5                                            _| | |_(123456)         not possible              |_     _|                                           1 |_|_| 4                                             2   3                          _5                  _1(12)(3456)              _| |_              2_| |_ _                      _|  _  |_            |_ _    |_                    _|  _|_|_  |_            |_     _|                 6_|  _|1| |_|_  |_          3 |_|_| 6                 |_  |_2>|  _|_|  _|           4   5                   |_  |_| |_|  _| 4                     |_       _|                       |_   _|                         |_|                         3                   1_   _4(12)(34)(56)      _| |_| |_ _6             same                 |_ _   _   _|                 2   |_| |_|                     3     5</pre>
