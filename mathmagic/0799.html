In chess, it is well known that under normal circumstances, White needs (in addition to his King of course) a Queen, a Rook, 2 Bishops, or a Bishop and Knight to mate a lone Black King.  But what about other possible pieces?  Can White mate with an additional piece that moves like a king?  How about a Rook that moves no more than 2 squares at a time?  How many Rooks that only move 1 square at a time are needed?  Feel free to invent your own pieces.<p>A Rook has 28 different moves (7 translations up, 7 down, 7 left, and 7 right).  What is the fewest number of moves that a piece can have and still mate a lone King?<p>Here are some miscellaneous chess quickies:<p><h3>Quickie #1:</h3> Find a legal chess position in which we can conclude that at least one of the players has castled, but we don't know which.<p><h3>Quickie #2:</h3> Place a White King, White Pawn, and Black King on an n x n chess board at random.  Let p(n) be the probability that if White moves first, White can win (that is, White can safely promote the pawn).  As n&rarr;&infin;, p(n) converges to what value?<p><h3>Quickie #3:</h3> Who wins this 5x5 mini-chess game?  Can you prove it is a tie?<p><center><img src="0799/5x5.gif"></center><p>

<P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>There weren't many responses this month.  White can mate with an additional King, or with a Rook that moves no more than 2 squares at a time.  The strategy is fairly complicated.  I can also mate with 3 additional Rooks that move only 1 square at a time. Can any one do it with 2 such pieces?<p>The smallest number of moves that a piece can have and mate is probably 6.  One piece that works is a King that cannot move diagonally backward.  To mate, get the King and modified King to the bottom of the board, then use the 2 Kings vs. 1 King strategy referred to above.<p>This month's problem comes from Ed Pegg. <p><h3>Quickie #1:</h3>Here is such a position:<p><center><img src="0799/q1.gif"></center><p>Each side has a promoted Rook.  Since the Pawns did not pass each other on the c-file, at least one Pawn made three captures: off the c-file, back on to the c-file, promote on the d-file.  Now each side's Queen's Rook and King's Bishop were captured on the back rank and not on the d-file.  Therefore the three pieces captured must have been the Queen, a Knight, and the King's Rook.  If A captured B's Rook on the d-file, then B must have castled, for his King and Rook have no other way to switch places.<p>

<h3>Quickie #2:</h3> John Hoffman thinks the answer is larger than 3/4, but smaller than 7/8.  He came up with a very complicated integral for computing the exact probability.<p>Alan Williams, who suggested this problem, thinks the answer is 149/192.  A Monte Carlo simulation with billions of trials supports this conjecture.  And finally in 2001 Ulrich Schimke</a> proved it!  Here is his <a href="0799/KKP.html">proof</a>, written up as a text file.<p>

<h3>Quickie #3:</h3>I'm pretty sure this game is a tie, and the state space is just small enough that someone might prove it with brute force.  But no one has yet.<p><HR><p>If you can extend any of these results, please <a href="mailto:erichfriedman68@gmail.com">e-mail</a> me.  Click <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/">here</a> to go back to Math Magic.  <font size=-1>Last updated 4/20/01.<font></BODY></HTML>
