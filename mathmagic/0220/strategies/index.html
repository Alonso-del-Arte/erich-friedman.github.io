<HTML><center><font size=+2>Problem 1283: Directing a Tournament</font></center><p>

<font size=+1>You are the director of a tournament involving four players, A, B, C, D. The players are linearly ordered in terms of ability, but you do not know this order. Your job is to design a tournament that consists of a series of N games in order to maximize the probability that the best player is the champion. In every game between two players, the better player has a 2/3 chance of winning.<p>

For example, if N = 3, the best tournament is A vs. B, C vs. D, and then the two winners against each other. The best team will win with probability (2/3)(2/3) = 44.4%. The tournament with A vs. B, with the winner vs. C, and the winner vs. D is not as good. The best player wins that tournament with probability (2/4)(2/3)<sup>3</sup> + (1/4)(2/3)<sup>2</sup> + (1/4)(2/3) = 42.6%.<p>

Suppose you have N=8 games at your disposal.  Design a tournament that has the best player winning more than 53% of the time.<p>
