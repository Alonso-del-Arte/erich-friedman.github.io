For example, the usual square tiling of the plane is an 8-neighbor tiling, but there are also 7-neighbor tilings and 6-neighbor tilings of the plane using squares.  The question is this: among all n-neighbor tilings for a fixed value of n, what is the fewest number of different tiles needed?<p>For example, there are <b>monohedral tilings</b>, tilings which use congruent copies of one tile only, which are n-neighbor tilings for n=6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 21.  Can you find them?  Are these the only ones?  For <b>dihedral tilings</b>, tiling using two different tiles, n-neighbor tilings exist for n=11, 13, and 15.  Can you find these?  Are there any others?<p><P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>Joseph DeVincentis, Andrew Bayly, and Berend Jan van der Zwaag found monohedral n-neighbor tilings for n=6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 21.  Such tilings are shown below.<p><center><img src="0701/mono.gif"></center><p>Here are the dihedral 11-neighbor and 13-neighbor tilings.<p><center><img src="0701/11,13.gif"></center><p>And here is my recently discovered dihedral 15-neighbor tiling.  Berend Jan van der Zwaag found it too.<p><center><img src="0701/15.gif"></center><p>Berend Jan van der Zwaag also found dihedral tilings with 32 and 43 neighbors respectively. <center><img src="0701/32,43.gif"></center><p>Of course by using the same trick we can get a k-hedral (22k&ndash;1)-neighbor tiling, and a k-hedral (22k-12)-neighbor tiling for all k.

This led to us publishing a joint paper, that can be found <a href="http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/papers/dihedral.pdf">here</a>.<p><hr>If you can extend any of these results, please <a href="mailto:erich.friedman@stetson.edu">e-mail</a> me.  Click <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/">here</a> to go back to Math Magic.  <font size=-1>Last updated 8/12/01.<font>
