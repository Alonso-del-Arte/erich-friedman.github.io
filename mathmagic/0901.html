Are R(n) and S(n) eventually increasing?  Do R(n) and S(n) grow exponentially?  What else can you prove about R(n) and S(n)? <p>If we define <b>N(n)</b> to be the number of different collections of n squares that can be arranged in a square, then what can you say about N(n)?

<P><hr><p><center><h1>ANSWERS</h1></center>Joseph DeVincentis and Berend Jan van der Zwaag wrote computer programs that calculated N(n), S(n), and R(n) for n &le; 13.  Their results are show below:<p><center><table border=2 bgcolor="FFFFCF" cellpadding=5><tr><th bgcolor=lightgreen>n<th bgcolor=lightgreen>N(n)<th bgcolor=lightgreen>S(n)<th bgcolor=lightgreen>R(n)</tr><tr align=center><td>1<td>1<td>1<td>1</tr><tr align=center><td>2<td>0<td>0<td>0</tr><tr align=center><td>3<td>0<td>0<td>0</tr><tr align=center><td>4<td>1<td>1<td>1</tr><tr align=center><td>5<td>0<td>0<td>0</tr><tr align=center><td>6<td>1<td>1<td>4</tr><tr align=center><td>7<td>1<td>2<td>8</tr><tr align=center><td>8<td>2<td>6<td>36</tr><tr align=center><td>9<td>4<td>16<td>105</tr><tr align=center><td>10<td>7<td>56<td>384</tr><tr align=center><td>11<td>18<td>183<td>1340</tr><tr align=center><td>12<td>40<td>657<td>4975</tr><tr align=center><td>13<td>118<td>2276<td>17668</tr></table></center>Here are some pictures for n &le; 9.<p><center><img src="0901/s1-7.gif"></center><p><center><img src="0901/s8.gif"></center><p><center><img src="0901/s9.gif"></center><p>Berend Jan van der Zwaag proved several inequalities for R(n) and S(n) for larger values of n.  For example, S(n+3) &ge; R(n)/2 since we can cut a square into 4 subsquares and replace one subsquare with any instance counted in R(n).  The factor of 1/2 is because the result might have diagonal symmetry through the centers.  Similarly, R(n+3) &ge; 4 R(n).  This shows that R(n) grows exponentially.  He notes that there are many other inequalities by replacing any square in any tiling with a tiling of subsquares.<p>Berend Jan van der Zwaag notes that any tiling has between 1 and 8 symmetries, so S(n) &ge; R(n) &ge; 8 S(n).  This shows that S(n) grows exponentially as well.  He also makes the conjecture that lim<sub>n&rarr;&infin;</sub>R(n) / S(n) = 8.<p>Berend Jan van der Zwaag asked whether there is any tiling of a square by squares so that the squares can not be rearranged so that the largest square is in a corner.  Then he found the smallest such example, shown below:<p><center><img src="0901/square.gif"></center><p><HR>If you can extend any of these results, please <a href="mailto:erich.friedman@stetson.edu">e-mail</a> me.  Click <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/">here</a> to go back to Math Magic.  <font size=-1>Last updated 10/9/01.<font></BODY></HTML>
