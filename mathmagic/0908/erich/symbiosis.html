<h2 align=center>Symbiotic couples <small>(by Claudio Baiocchi, September 14, 2008)</small></h2>
  <h3>The notion of Jolly</h3>
Let us consider a rectangle with side-ratio 5:2, and try to split it into two copies of the
same omino. We can do that in many ways: e.g. two copies of I5, or two
copies of P5, or two copies of L5; and also two copies (at different scales) of I2.

We will call &#8221;Jolly for A, B&#8221; an omino splittable both as two copies of A and two
copies of B; we believe that such a notion can help to find upper bounds for the
symbiosis number of the couple (A,B).
Of course other ominoes can work as Jolly; e.g. a rectangle with side-ratio 1:3 is a
Jolly for the couple (L6,I6) as well as for the couples (L6,O6) and (I6,O6). Here we
will confine ourselves to deal with Jolly given by the rectangle with side-ratio
2:5.
We will use some combinations of our jolly as &#8221;bricks&#8221; for build other figures; e.g. the
square-brick is the union of 4 jollies; and the domino-brick is union of 5
jollies. The following colors for jolly and bricks will help to fast interpret some
figures later on:

   <h3>The couple (I2,L5)</h3>

In the following figure we can interpret the fuchsia zone as a couple (L5,I2);
by suitably choosing the decompositions of the remaining 7 Jollies (two
yellow, 5 cyan) we can thus tile L5 with x Dominoes and 16-x L5 for any odd x.

In order to get tiling with x Dominoes and 16-x L5 for even values of x, we tile I2
instead of L5. This is quite trivial, because it suffices to represent I2 as two squares,
say 8 Jollies; that allow in fact the wanted even decompositions.
<p>It follows that 16 is (an upper bound for) the symbiosis number of the couple (L5,I2).


   <h3>Other examples</h3>

Now we show that 22 is an upper bound for the symbiosis number of the couple
(L5,I5), as well as for the couple (L5,P5).
<p> We will still use the same Jolly; the following figure shows how to tile L5 through two dominoes and one Jolly; say by 11 jollies. This allow any &#8221;even&#8221; decomposition [x,22-x] for both couples (L5,I5) and (L5,O5).

In order to get the &#8221;odd&#8221; decompositions it suffices to look at the figures:

where again fuchsia zones represent a couple of different ominoes.
