<font size=+2>#1.</font> In <a href="1298/">December 1998</a>, we considered tiling squares with integer-sided squares, and defined <b>h(n)</b> to be the maximum multiplicity of any square needed to tile the n&times;n square.  Prove or disprove h(n)&le;2 for all n&ge;22.<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> If n&ge;22 is an integer, then a n&times;n square can be tiled by other integer-sided squares, using no more than 2 squares of any given size.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#2.</font> In <a href="0299/">February 1999</a>, we explored tiling rectangles with linear disconnected polyominoes.  Do any of the 7 "length 9" polyominoes below tile any rectangle?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> None of the shapes above can tile a rectangle.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#3.</font> In <a href="0499/">April 1999</a>, we defined a shape to be <b>n-convex</b> if n copies of it can be arranged in a convex shape, and we defined the <b>spectrum</b> of a shape to be the set of all n for which the shape is n-convex.  Is there a shape with spectrum {1,5}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {4,5}, {1,3,5}, {1,4,5}, {2,3,5}, {2,4,5}, {3,4,5}, {1,2,4,5}, or {1,3,4,5}?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> No shape has any of the above spectra.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#4.</font> In <a href="0800/">August 2000</a>, we defined a number to be a <b>Friedman number</b> if it can be written in a non-trivial way using its digits and the operations + &ndash; &times; / ^ ( ) and concatenation.  A <b>nice Friedman number</b> uses the digits in the same order.  All of the 6-digit Friedman numbers are known.  Are there any other 6-digit nice Friedman numbers other than the ones listed <a href="0800/6digitnice.html">here</a>?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> There are some 6-digit nice Friedman numbers yet to be discovered.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#5.</font> In <a href="1200/">December 2000</a>, we explored equations of the form &Pi; (a<sub>i</sub>)<sup>(b<sub>i</sub>)</sup> = &Pi; (c<sub>i</sub>)<sup>(d<sub>i</sub>)</sup> where the integers from 1 to 2n each appear exactly once as one of the a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub> or d<sub>i</sub>.  Is this always possible for n&ge;2?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> For every n&ge;2, the equation &Pi; (a<sub>i</sub>)<sup>(b<sub>i</sub>)</sup> = &Pi; (c<sub>i</sub>)<sup>(d<sub>i</sub>)</sup> has a solution where the integers from 1 to 2n each appear exactly once as one of the a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub> or d<sub>i</sub>.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#6.</font> In <a href="1201/">December 2001</a>, we defined a <b>k-slab</b> to be a (k)&times;(ik)&times;(jk) box for some integers i and j.  What cubes can be tiled with k-slabs for 1&le;k&le;n, besides the trivial 1&times;1&times;1 cube (for n=1) and the 6&times;6&times;6 cube (for n=3)?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> There are infinitely many cubes that can be tiled with k-slabs for 1&le;k&le;n.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#7.</font> In <a href="0802/">August 2002</a>, we defined the <b>partridge number</b> of the shape S to be the smallest n for which 1 copy of S, 2 copies of S magnified by 2, 3 copies of S magnified by 3, ... up to n copies of S magnified by n can tile a copy of S magnified by n(n+1)/2.  The smallest known partridge number is 4, for a 30-60-90 right triangle, and for any trapezoid with bases of length 3 and 6 and a side of length 8.  Are there any other shapes that have partridge number 4?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> There are other shapes with partridge number 4.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#8.</font> In <a href="1102/">November 2002</a>, we defined an integer matrix to be a <b>sum-product</b> matrix if the sum of each row is the same, and the product of each column is the same.  There are even 2&times;n sum-product matrices where the common sum and common product are the same.  Are there m&times;n sum-product matrices with this property with m&ge;3?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> Every sum-product matrix with the common sum equal to the common product has only 2 rows.<p>

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#9.</font> In <a href="1103/">November 2003</a>, we defined a <b>Hanoi tiling</b> of a square as a tiling with integer-sided squares so that each square not on the bottom layer lies on top of one or more larger squares.  It is known that every n&times;n for n&ge;34 has a Hanoi tiling.  Even if we insist that the bottom layer of such a tiling have at least k squares, is it true that every sufficiently large square has a Hanoi tiling?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> Every sufficiently large square has a Hanoi tiling with k squares on its bottom layer.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#10.</font> In <a href="0505/">May 2005</a>, we studied tilings of rectangles with equal number of squares of sides 1 through n.  It is known that 2 of each square tile a rectangle for 1&le;n&le;20 and for n=24.  Is this also true for 21&le;n&le;23 and n&ge;25?<p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> Two squares each of sides 1 through n always tile some rectangle.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#11.</font> In <a href="1105/">November 2005</a>, we explored the adjacency graphs of sets of identical polyominoes.  What are the smallest configurations of identical polyominoes with these 4-regular adjacency graphs?<p>

<table align=center><tr align=center>
<td><img src="1105/4r6.gif"><td width=50>

<td><img src="1105/4r103.gif"><td width=50>
<td><img src="1105/4r112.gif">
</table><p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> All of these graphs can be realized as the adjacency graph of some set of identical polyominoes.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#12.</font> In <a href="1205/">December 2005</a>, we investigated <b>matchstick graphs</b>, planar graphs where every edge has unit length.  We asked what the smallest matchstick graph was where every vertex has degree 4 or 11.  The smallest known graph has changed more than a dozen times since then.  Now the smallest known is the graph below.  Is this the smallest one?<p>

<center><img src="1205/d4,11.gif"></center><p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> There is a smaller matchstick graph whose vertices all have degree 4 or 11.

<p><hr><p><font size=+2>#13.</font> In <a href="0206/">February 2006</a>, we explored 4-regular planar graphs where the edges incident to each vertex has given lengths.  Only these 3 graphs are known, but surely there are more.<p>

</table><p>

<b>Conjecture:</b> There are infinitely many such graphs with edge lengths {1,1,1,x} and {1,1,x,x} for various values of x.
