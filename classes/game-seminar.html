<title> Game Theory</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 395 - Seminar in Game Theory</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet MWF at 9:00 in Elizabeth 202.
We will be using two textbooks,
"Lessons in Play" by Albert et al, and "An Introduction to Game
Theory" by Osborne.  This course is an
advanced course on mathematical decision making in competitive
situations.  Although it can be
considered a continuation of MS 152, it can also stand alone as a
rigorous introduction to combinatorial
and classical game theory.  Most days I will answer homework
questions from the previous material for
10--15 minutes, and discuss new material for the remaining time.
You can find out what we will be doing
each day in class by consulting the syllabus. Game Theory is a
relatively new field of mathematics. The
material we'll be learning was developed less than 75 years ago.  I
hope you enjoy learning it with
me.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:efriedma@stetson.edu">efriedma@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.  My office isElizabeth 214-2, and my office extension is 7552.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Monday 10:00 - 11:00 <br><li>Tuesday 2:00 - 4:00 <br><li>Wednesday 10:00 - 11:00<br><li>Friday 10:00 - 11:00 <br></ul></ul>This means that I am always in my office during these times, and you can drop bywithout an appointment.  If you cannot make my regularly scheduled hours, let me knowand we can set up another time to talk.  Please come by if you need help, or if youjust want to chat.  You will soon see that my lecture style is informal.  I will becalling you by your first name (or a nickname if you prefer), so please call meErich. <p><H3>About you:  </H3>You will need some mathematical
sophistication to succeed in this course.  We
will be using matrices, but you will not need to remember any
traditional linear algebra.  We will be
taking some partial derivatives.  You will be expected to understand
and write proofs.  If you choose to
come to class, come on time, and please don't socialize in class.<p><H3>About the honor code:  </H3>Stetson has an honor code.  You are not
only
expected to do your own work, but to tell me if another student is
not.  The punishment for
cheating is an F in the course.<p>

<H3>About cell phones:  </H3>I hate them.  If one goes off in class,
for any reason, it's mine for the
rest of the day.<p><H3>About your grade:</H3><b>The Homework</b> for each day and
answers to each problem have been handed
out.  The homework will not be collected, but I will answer homework
questions in class as time permits.
Since these problems will help prepare you for the quizzes and tests,
you should do them.  Feel free to
work together on the homework problems, but make sure you can do them
by yourself by test time.  Make sure
you ask about homework problems that you can't do.
<p><b>Quizzes and Tests</b> will be given
on the 7 dates
announced on the syllabus.  Please check your schedule now to see
that there are no
conflicts.  If you are going to miss a quiz or test, please arrange
something with me beforehand.  If you
miss a quiz or test without telling me beforehand, you will lose 10\%
of your grade per day, no
exceptions.  On the quizzes and tests, you will be expected to show
your work and explain your answers.
Each quiz is worth 50 points, and each test is worth 100 points.
<p>

<b>Projects</b> concerning some topic
in Game Theory can be done either
individually or in groups.  The possible topics are available first
come, first served.  Each group will be
responsible for a presentation some evening near the end of the
course, and a paper on the chosen topic.
The presentations should be about 10 minutes long per person in the
group.  The paper should be
approximately 5 pages long per person in the group.  The presentation
and the paper are each worth 50
points.  The material presented is fair game for the final exam, so
should be explained well, and have
the appropriate handouts.<p>
<b>The Final Exam</b> is comprehensive and is worth 200 points.  There are a total of 800 points.
