<title>Precalculus</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 101 - Precalculus</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet MWF at 1:30 inElizabeth 209.  This course will essentially cover material from the appendix and the first 5chapters of the text, <i>Precalculus</i> by Hornsby, Lial, and Rockswold. Topics of the courseinclude basic algebra, the function concept, graphing, solving equations and inequalities, andvarious examples of functions: linear, quadratic, power, root, rational, exponential, andlogarithm.  Although this course is primarily designed toprepare you for a calculus course, we will also be doing applications of these topics.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:efriedma@stetson.edu">efriedma@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.  My office isElizabeth 214-2.  My office extension is 7552.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Monday 9:00 - 11:00 <br><li>Tuesday 2:00 - 4:00 <br><li>Wednesday 2:30 - 3:30<br><li>Friday 9:00 - 11:00 <br></ul></ul>This means that I am always in my office during these times, and you can drop bywithout an appointment.  If you cannot make my regularly scheduled hours, let me knowand we can set up another time to talk.  Please come by if you need help, or if youjust want to chat.  You will soon see that my lecture style is informal.  I will becalling you by your first name (or a nickname if you prefer), so please call meErich.<p>
<H3>About you:  </H3>You should have taken and not passed the math placement test. (If you have not taken this test, see the secretary in the math office, Elizabeth211.)  You should be planning on following this course with a calculus course,either MS 226, MS 222, or MS 201  (If you are not planning to take calculus, youshould take MS 151-159 instead). You should have a working knowledge ofarithmetic and basic knowledge of algebra.   You should be respectful of both me and yourclassmates.  This means coming to class on time and not socializing in class.  <p>

<H3>About a calculator:  </H3>You are expected to have and know how to use a graphingcalculator.  I will be using a TI-83 in class.  You should bring your calculator to tests, butyou are not allowed to use one on the quizzes.<p>

<H3>About the honor code:  </H3>Stetson has recently adopted an honor code.  You are not onlyexpected to do your own work, but to tell me if another student is not.  The punishment forcheating is an F in the course.<p><H3>About the math department:  </H3>I am usually available to answer your questions,but the math department offers several additional ways to get help.  Much of the day,free math tutors can be found in the math office, Elizabeth 211.  Also, themath secretary has a list of paid tutors available at other times.   There is also amath clinic which runs every Monday through Thursday  7:00-10:00 pm inElizabeth 209.  Please seek help as soon as you fall behind.<p><H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> is assigned every class period from the section we talkedabout.  Only do the odd problems, as these have answers in the back of the book.  Homework willnot be collected, but I will answer homework questions in class as time permits.  Since theseproblems will help prepare you for the quizzes and tests, you should do them.  Feel free to worktogether on the homework problems, but make sure you can do them yourself.  Make sure you askabout homework problems that you can't do.  You should do as much or as little homework as youneed, but the leading causes of failing this course are not being prepared for this course,and not doing enough homework.<p><b>Quizzes</b> in this course are of the "Gateway" variety.  That meansyou may take a quiz several times, but you must do well for it to count. The first attempt on a quiz will be given in class on the date announced on the syllabus.  Eachquiz covers the most recent lectures and consists of 8 calculational problems.  Calculatorsare not allowed on quizzes, and there is no partial credit.  Each of the 4 quizzes is worth50 points if you pass it on the first attempt, 45 points if you pass it on the second attempt,then 40 points, then 35, then 30, then 25.  Further attempts on quizzes can be made during office hourstwice a week.  If you have not passed a quiz by the time we have a test on that topic, you willearn a 0 for that quiz. The "Gateway" approach encourages you to concentrate on certain fundamental skillsuntil you master them.  If you cannot demonstrate a skill, even after several tries, this is ahint that you are not ready for this course, or not trying hard enough.<p>

<b>Tests</b> will be given on the 4 datesannounced on the syllabus.  Please check your schedule now to see that there are noconflicts.  The tests are a combination of routine problems, and applications we have coveredsince the quizzes.  If you are going to miss a quiz or test, please arrange something with me beforehand.  If you miss a quiz or test without telling me beforehand, you will lose 10% of your grade per day, noexceptions.  I do give partial credit on tests, though you areexpected to show your work and justify your answers.  The tests are worth 100 points each.<p><b>The Final Exam</b> is comprehensive and is worth 200 points.  There are atotal of 800 points available.<p>

<b>The Grading Scale</b> is shown below.  Please note that thestandard 90--80--70--60 scale has been shifted to account for the gateway quizzes, but that I donot award D's in this course.  You need to achieve a certain level of competence in this course tosucceed in the next one.<p>
