<title> Preparation for Senior Research </title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 497 - Preparation for Senior Research</H1></center><center><H2>Organizer: Erich Friedman (<a href="mailto:efriedma@stetson.edu">efriedma@stetson.edu</a>)</H2></center><H3>What is this course?</H3> This is a course designed to prepare youfor  MS 498 Senior Research next semester.  You are expected to find an advisor in thedepartment to work with on your research, pick a research project, begin yourresearch, write a research proposal, and give a talk about your chosen topic. <p><H3>What is math research?</H3> This differs widely by field.  Puremathematicians often experiment, conjecture, and then prove their guesses.  Appliedmathematicians often do statistical studies, optimize a system, or generatealgorithms with fewer proofs.  Some projects will require a literature search.  Someprojects will require computer programming.  Whatever your project is, you will beworking on your own and should do your own work.<p><H3>Why is this course required?</H3> Most of the math curriculum studies mathematicsthat was created hundreds of years ago.   But you cannotfully understand what mathematics is all about unless you take part in the processof creating some.  It can be scary and frustrating doing new mathemmatics, but itcan also be rewarding, and looks very good on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;.<p><H3>How do I find an advisor?</H3> You can start by visiting the <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/departments/mathcs/people/facultyprojects.shtml">department project web site</a>. This web page contains general topics of interest and suggested individual projectsfor students to work on.  Hopefully you will find some faculty whose interests are thesame as yours.  Next you should visit these professors for more details aboutpossible projects.<p><H3>How do I find a research problem?</H3> Maybe your advisor has some particularproblems for you to work on.  You might find a problem on the internet, fromone of your upper division courses, from a math meeting you attended, or from adepartment colloquium you went to.  Some faculty are willing to let students pick aproblem from a field they are interested in, and they will have a list of internetresources available.<p><H3>How will this work?</H3> We will not be meeting as a class.  You will schedulemeetings with your advisor every week.  You should set weekly goals, and keep tothem.  As coordinator, I will meet with you at the beginning of every month, and will contact youradvisor separately by e-mail to get an update on your project.  This is a 1 creditcourse, so plan to spend at least 2 hours per week on your research outside ofyour meetings.  Most students spend more.<p><H3>Am I expected to have original results in the fall?</H3> Not necessarily.  Someprojects require more learning up front.  But the more you get done this fall, themore you will have done by the end of MS 498.  If you don't have results this fall,you have a heavier burden to demonstrate that you understand and can succeed withyour project.<p><H3>Am I expected to publish my results?</H3> There are undergraduate math journalsthat would publish good research projects.  This is something to strive for, but itis not required.<p><H3>How do I write my proposal?</H3> A <a href="s.r.template.doc">WORD template</a> will be provided to you.  Youshould use this template for both your proposal this semester and research projectnext semester.  You should write results as you get them rather than wait for the endof the semester.  This way you can get feedback as you go, and won't be as busy at theend of the semester.  You should be formal and precise in your paper.  A rough draftis due  before the final draft.  For both the rough draft and final draft, you shouldgive a paper copy to your advisor and an electronic copy to the organizer.<p><H3>What guidelines I should follow in giving credit?</H3> If you use someone else'sidea, you should give that person credit.  This could happen because you read apaper, attended a talk at a conference, found material on a web page, or talked witha faculty member.  See the template for examples of citations.  You can alsogive more general thanks to others on your acknowledgement page.<p><H3>To whom do I present the proposal?</H3> All the departmentfaculty will be there, and all the students in the department are invited.  You shouldfeel free to invite other visitors.  You are required to attend all the proposalpresentations of your fellow math majors.  Refreshments will be served.<p><H3>What sort of presentation is expected?</H3> You should use PowerPoint or overheadslides.  You should plan to talk for 15-20 minutes about your problem, what youdid this semester, and what you plan to do next semester.  Your presentation may beless formal and less complete than your paper, but you should still be precise.  Youshould be prepared to answer questions and get constructive feedback on yourproposal.  You should practice your presentation before you give it - a talk getsbetter every time you give it.<p>

<H3>Will I be exempted from the communications requirement?</H3> The department no longerroutinely exempts students from this requirement.<p>
<H3>What's the timeline?</H3> <p><center><table border=3 bgcolor=lightyellow><tr><td>First Day of Class<td>Wednesday, August 25</tr><tr><td>Deadline to Pick Advisor<td>Friday, September 3</tr><tr><td>Proposal Abstract Due<td>Friday, October 8</tr><tr><td>Rough Draft of Proposal Due<td>Wednesday, November 17</tr><tr><td>Final Draft of Proposal Due<td>Wednesday, November 24</tr><tr><td>Proposal Presentations<td>December 6, 7, and 8</tr></table></center><p>

<H3>Who will be grading me?</H3> Your grades in MS 497 and MS 498 will be determined by theentire department faculty.  Your advisor and the coordinator will determine yourmidterm grade.<p>
<H3>How am I graded?</H3> You will be graded on how well the faculty think you understand yourproblem, and how much progress you have made on it this semester.  Things that willnegatively impact your grade: not keeping to the deadlines above, missing meetingswith your advisor, making little or no progress on a weekly basis, not making theindicated changes in your rough draft, writing a sloppy or incomplete paper, giving a poor presentation, or being unable to answer questions about your project.<p>

<H3>Can you give me some percentages?</H3> Your grade will be determined 10\% on whether you keep yourmeetings with your advisor and make steady progress, 65\% on your research proposal, and 25\% onyour presentation.  Failure to meet the above deadlines will be penalized 5\% per day.<p><H3>What if I'm afraid?</H3> Don't be.  Every graduate from our program has livedthrough this, and the vast majority of them enjoyed the experience.  Don't getdiscouraged if you don't get results right away.  A year is a long time.<p>
