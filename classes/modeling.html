<title> Mathematical Modeling</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 350 - Mathematical Modeling</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet every MWF at 1:30 in Elizabeth206.  There is no text for this course.  There is no fixed syllabus, but topics of thecourse may include the basics of modeling, optimization models, statistical models,dynamic models, spatial models, and stochastic models.  You will be expected tocontribute to the class discussion, do occasional projects, including a final projectand class presentation.  Occasionally, we will branch off and talk about models thatdo not fit into one of the many categories above.  Hopefully this will convince youthat modeling is creative and non-linear.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:erich.friedman@stetson.edu">erich.friedman@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.  My office isElizabeth 214-2.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Monday 2:30 - 3:30<br><li>Tuesday  11:00 - 12:00<br><li>Wednesday  10:00 - 11:00 and 2:30 - 3:30<br>   <li>Friday  2:30 - 3:30<p></ul></ul>This means that I am always in my office during these times, and you can drop bywithout an appointment.  If you cannot make my regularly scheduled hours, let me knowand we can set up another time to talk.  Please come by if you need help, or if youjust want to chat.  You will soon see that my lecture style is informal.  I will becalling you by your first name (or a nickname if you prefer), so please call meErich. <H3>About you:</H3>  You should have some computer programming experience.You should have at least MS 201 and MS 202, and the more math you have had the better,as this class has some overlap with MS 203, MS 316, MS 371, and MS 372.   Please berespectful of both me and your classmates.  This means coming to class on time andnot socializing in class. Cheating will not be tolerated.<H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Class Participation</b> is an important part of this course.  We will bediscussing models and ways to approach them or improve them, and more suggestionsand criticisms will make better models.  Note that it is hard to participate if youdo not come to class.  Participation will be 1/6 of your grade. <p><b>Homework</b> will be rarely be assigned, but when it is, it will becollected and graded the next class period.  Failure to do this homework will resultin severe injury.<p><b>Small Projects</b> will be assigned every week or two, due a week ortwo later. These projects will allow you to practice modeling techniques we arediscussing in class.   You should hand in a written report (usually a couple pages) bythe due date.   Please explain your work well - getting the "right" answer isnot enough.  You may work on these projects in groups subject to the following rule:you may not work with the same person twice. A group only needs to hand in one copyof the project.  Together, the projects will comprise 1/2 of your grade. <p><b>The Final Project</b> in the course will be longer, and will be doneindividually.  I will suggest a list of possible projects, but I am willing tolisten to other ideas you may have.  During the last three weeks of class, you willgive an oral presentation of your project.  The presentation, including questionsfrom the audience, should last 20 minutes.  Computer demonstrations and results areencouraged. The entire department will be invited to attend.  You are encouragedto give your final project presentation as part of the Math/CS Seminar.  You shouldalso hand in a written report. The oral presentation and the written report are eachworth 1/6 of your final grade.
