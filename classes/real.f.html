The more youremember, the better.  Other proof-intensive courses like MS305 and MS411 will have givenyou more practice.  You should be respectful of both me and your classmates.  This meanscoming to class on time and not socializing in class.  <H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> will be assigned from every section we cover, but Iwill not collect it.  Instead, we will discuss homework for roughly half of the followingclass period.  Feel free to work together on the homework problems, but make sure you coulddo similar problems on a test by yourself.  If you can't do a homework problem, make sureyou ask about it in class or during my office hours.  <p><b>Quizzes and Tests</b> will be given on each chapter, as indicated onthe syllabus.  Each quiz will be half the period, and will be worth 25 points.  Eachtest will consist of an in-class portion that will take the entire period worth 100 points,and a take-home portion due the next class period worth 25 points.  You are allowed to useyour book and your notes on the take-home portion, but you are not allowed to use otherpeople, other books, or the internet.<p><b>The Final Exam</b> will be 2 hours long, given in class.  It willbe comprehensive, and will be worth 200 points.  There are 800 points total. .
