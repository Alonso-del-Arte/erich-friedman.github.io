<html><title> Senior Research </title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 498 - Senior Research</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>What is this course?</H3> This is the continuation of MS 497.  Now that you havean advisor and a research topic, you should continue work on your project.  At the endof the semester, you will write up your results and present them to the department. <p><H3>Is it too late to change my research topic?</H3> Yes, though you may find youneed to modify your proposed project and do less if the project is too hard or domore if the project is too easy.<p><H3>How will this work?</H3> You will continuemeeting with your advisor on a weekly basis.  As coordinator, I will meet with youat the beginning of every month, and your contact your advisor separately to get an update onyour project.  This is a 3 credit course, so plan to spend at least 6 hours per week on yourresearch.  <p><H3>What sort of paper is expected?</H3> You will use the same <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/classes/s.r.template.doc">WORD template</a> as lastsemester.  Presumably you will have more tables, figures and results, so your paperwill be longer.  I encourage you to write results as you get them rather thanwait for the end of the semester.  You should be formal and precise in yourpaper.  A rough draft is due before the final draft.  For both the rough draft andfinal draft, you should give a paper copy to your advisor and an electronic copy tothe organizer.<p><H3>What sort of presentation is expected?</H3> You should use PowerPoint or overheadslides.  You should plan to talk for 20-25 minutes about your problem and what youdid this semester.  Assume your audience came to your proposal so they aregenerally familiar with your topic, but remind them of any pertinent definitionsor details.  Your presentation may be less formal and less complete than yourfinal paper.<p><H3>What's the timeline?</H3><p><center><table border=1><tr><td>First Day of Class <td>Wednesday, August 25</tr><tr><td>Abstract of Project Due     <td> Friday, October 8</tr><tr><td>Rough Draft of Paper Due   <td> Wednesday, November 17</tr><tr><td>Final Paper Due   <td> Wednesday, November 24</tr><tr><td>Research Presentations    <td> December 6, 7, and 8</tr></table></center>

<H3>Who will be grading me?</H3> Your grade will be determined by theentire department faculty.  Your advisor and the coordinator will determine yourmidterm grade.<p>
<H3>How am I graded?</H3> You will be graded on how well the faculty think you understand yourproblem, and how much progress you have made on it this semester.  Things that willnegatively impact your grade: not keeping to the deadlines above, missing meetingswith your advisor, making little or no progress on a weekly basis, not making theindicated changes in your rough draft, writing a sloppy or incomplete paper, giving a poor presentation, or being unable to answer questions about your project.<p>

<H3>Can you give me some percentages?</H3> Your grade will be determined 10\% on whether you keep yourmeetings with your advisor and make steady progress, 65\% on your research paper, and 25\% onyour presentation.  Failure to meet the above deadlines will be penalized 5\% per day.<p>
