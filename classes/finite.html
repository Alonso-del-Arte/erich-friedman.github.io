<title>Finite Math</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 151 - Finite Math</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet Monday mornings at 10:00 (for 50 minutes) andTuesdays and Thurdays at 2:30 in the afternoon (for 75 minutes) in Elizabeth 209. This course will cover chapters 1, 2, 7, and 8 of the text, <i>Mathematics: A HumanEndeavor</i> by Harold Jacobs, as well as some other material.  The topics we will coverare inductive and deductive reasoning, number sequences, mathematicalalgorithms, combinatorics, and probability.  This course is an introduction tomathematical thinking and discovery.  We will <b>not</b> be memorizing uselessinformation, but rather learning how to solve mathematical problems that you may nothave seen before.  In addition to lectures, we will be having group discussions anddoing group activites in class.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:erich.friedman@stetson.edu">erich.friedman@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.  My office isElizabeth 214-2.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Monday 2:30 - 3:30<br><li>Tuesday  11:00 - 12:00<br><li>Wednesday  10:00 - 11:00<br>   <li>Thursday  4:00 - 5:00<p></ul></ul>I am <b>always</b> in my office during these times.  If you cannot make these regularlyscheduled hours, let me know and we can set up another time to talk.  Please come byif you need help, or if you just want to chat.  You will see that when I lecture, itis informal.  I will be calling you by your first name (or a nickname if youprefer), so please call me Erich.<H3>About you:  </H3>You will not need much prior mathematical knowledge forthis class.   Attendance in this class is not mandatory, but since some of your grade isbased on class participation, it would be wise of you to attend.  If you fall behindlater, come see me as soon as possible.  Please be respectful of both me and yourclassmates.  This means coming to class <b>on time</b> and not socializing in class. You will often be working in groups, but working together on the tests will obviouslynot be tolerated.<p><H3>About the math department:  </H3>I am usually available to answer your questions,but the math department offers several additional ways to get help.  Much of the day,free math tutors can be found in the math office, Elizabeth 211.  Also, Nancy, themath secretary has a list of paid tutors available at other times.   There is also amath clinic which runs most evenings in Elizabeth 209.  Please seek help as soon asyou fall behind.<H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> will usually not be collected, but I will answerquestions in class as time permits. These problems will help you prepare for thetests, and you should do them.  I encourage you to work together on the homeworkproblems, but make sure you can do them by yourself<p><b>Class Participation</b> is worth 1/4 of your grade. This includes contributing to the class discussion, working on the class activities,and possibly some pop quizzes.<p><b>Tests</b> will be given about every two to three weeks, andwill be announced at least a week before they occur.  I <b>do not</b> give make-uptests.  If you miss a test without telling me beforehand, you will receive a zero. You will be expected to show your work and justify your answers.  Each of the 4 testsis worth 1/8 of your grade.<p><b>The Final Exam</b> is comprehensive and is worth theremaining 1/4 of your grade.
