<title> Probability </title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MATH 371 - Probability</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet every MWF at 1:30 in Elizabeth 202.  Thiscourse will essentially cover the first ten chapters of the text, <i>Fundamentalsof Probability</i> by Ghahramani.  This course is an introduction to the mathematics ofchance, including combinatorial probability, conditional probability, probabilitydensities and distributions, discrete and continuous random variables, jointprobability, and limit theorems.  Probability has been an active field for over 300years.  Some students think it is hard, because it is often non-intuitive, but youwill find it extremely valuable to learn about the mathematics of chance.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:efriedma@stetson.edu">efriedma@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.  My office isElizabeth 214-2.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Monday 10:00 - 11:00<br><li>Tuesday 2:00 - 4:00<br>   <li>Wednesday  10:00 - 11:00<br><li>Friday  10:00 - 11:00<p></ul></ul>This means that I am always in my office during these times, and you can drop bywithout an appointment.  If you cannot make my regularly scheduled hours, let me knowand we can set up another time to talk.  Please come by if you need help, or if youjust want to chat.  You will soon see that my lecture style is informal.  I will becalling you by your first name (or a nickname if you prefer), so please call meErich. <H3>About you:  </H3>You will need a working knowledge of MATH 243 and MATH 255. In particular, we first use set theory and proofs in week 1, factorials in week 2,continuity in week 6, Taylor series in week 8, geometric series in week 9,differentiation and integration in week 10, the fundamental theorem of calculus inweek 11, sequences in week 12, and partial derivatives and multiple integrals in week13.<p>Please review now, as there will be no time for it later.  If you fall behind, comesee me as soon as possible.   Attendance in this class is not mandatory, but it willbe very hard for you to learn this material on your own if you do not come to class. Please be respectful of both me and your classmates.  This means coming to class ontime and not socializing in class.<p>

<H3>About the Math Department:   </H3>I am usually available to answer your questions, in andout of class, but the math department offers several additional ways to get help.  Much of theday, a free math tutor can be found in the math office, Elizabeth 211.  Also, themath secretary has a list of paid tutors available at other times.   There is also amath clinic which runs every MTWTh 2:30 - 4:30 and 7:00 - 10:00 pm inElizabeth 209.  Please seek help as soon as you fall behind.<p>

<H3>About the Honor Code:   </H3>Stetson has an honor code.  You are not onlyexpected to do your own work, but to tell me if another student is not.  The punishment forcheating is an F in the course.<p><H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> will not be collected, but I will answerquestions in class as time permits. These problems are an indication of whatthe test problems will look like.  I encourage you to work together on thehomework problems. You should do as much or as little homework as you need. Theleading causes of failing this course are not doing enough homework, and notremembering things from previous courses.<p>

<b>Quizzes</b> will be given on the 4 dates announced on the syllabus.  These are one page long and cover recent material.  Each quiz is worth 50 points.<p><b>Tests</b> will be given on the 4 dates announced on thesyllabus.  Please check your schedule now to see that there are no conflicts.  Missed quizzes or test incur a mandatory 10% per day penalty.   You will be expected to show your work and justify your answers.  Youshould bring a calculator to the quizzes and tests.  Each test is worth 100 points.<p><b>The Final Exam</b> is comprehensive and is worth 200 points.   There are 800 points total.  There is no extra credit available.
