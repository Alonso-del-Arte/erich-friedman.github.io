<title>Business Calculus</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 226 - Business Calculus</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:30 in Flagler201.  This course will essentially cover material from chapters 2, 3, and 4 of thetext, <i>Calculus for the Management, Life, and Social Sciences</i>by Kolman and Denlinger.  Topics of the course include the concepts of limits,derivatives, and extrema, with an emphasis on the meaning and usage of thederivative.  We will, of course, be using these ideas to solve business relatedproblems.  Unlike your previous math courses, you will find that calculus is notabout memorizing formulas.  It is about understanding the concepts of limitingbehavior and rates of change.  The development of this material some 300 years ago wasperhaps the greatest mathematical achievement in history.  I hope you enjoydiscovering it with me.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:erich.friedman@stetson.edu">erich.friedman@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.  My office isElizabeth 214-2.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Wednesday 1:30 - 3:30<br>   <li>Thursday  11:00 - 12:00  and  1:30 - 3:30<p></ul></ul><p>This means that I am always in my office during these times, and you can drop bywithout an appointment.  If you cannot make my regularly scheduled hours, let me knowand we can set up another time to talk.  Please come by if you need help, or if youjust want to chat.  You will soon see that my lecture style is informal.  I will becalling you by your first name (or a nickname if you prefer), so please call meErich. <H3>About you:  </H3>You should have passed MS 101 or the math placement test. Youshould be comfortable with fractional exponents, factoring, solving equations,graphing, exponential and logarithmic functions, and other methods of thatcourse. If you need to review this material, do so now, as there will be no time forit later.  Attendance in this class is not mandatory, but do not expect me to help youif you do not help yourself.  Please be respectful of both me and your classmates. This means coming to class on time and not socializing in class. Cheating will not betolerated.<p><H3>About the math department:  </H3>I am usually available to answer your questions,but the math department offers several additional ways to get help. Much of the day, free math tutors can be found in the math office, Elizabeth 211. Also, Nancy, the math secretary has a list of paid tutors available at other times.  There is also the Math Clinic which runs Monday through Thursday from 6 to 9 pm inElizabeth 209.  Please seek help as soon as you fall behind.<H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> will not be collected, but I will answerquestions in class as time permits. These problems are an indication of whatthe quiz and test problems will look like.  I encourage you to work together on thehomework problems. You should do as much or as little homework as you need, but theleading cause of failing this course is not doing enough homework.<p><b>Quizzes</b> (5 of them) are announced on the syllabus.  Thesequizzes will be 10-15 minutes long and will cover recent material.  The quizzes aremostly for your benefit.  If you are doing poorly on the quizzes, this should serveas a warning that you do not know the material.  Do something about it before thetest.  You cannot make up missed quizzes.  Each quiz is worth 10 points.<p><b>Tests</b> (4 of them) are also announced on the syllabus.  Youare allowed and encouraged to use a calculator, except on test #3.  Any calcuatorthat has a e<sup>x</sup> key and a ln x key will do fine.  You will be expected toshow your work and justify your answers.  I usually make up a practice test the weekbefore the exam, to give you an idea of what to expect.  I strongly suggest you trythese problems in a timed setting to prepare for the real thing.  I do not givemake-up tests.  If you miss a test without telling me beforehand, you will receive azero. Each test is worth 100 points.<p><b>The Final Exam</b> is comprehensive and is worth 250 points. There are 700 points total in the course.  The grading scale is 90%-80%-70%-60%.
