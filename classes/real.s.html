<title>Real Analysis II</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 402 - Real Analysis II</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 11:00 inElizabeth 202. This course is the continuation of MS 401.  We will still be usingmy notes <i>Hundreds of Theorems in Analysis</i>, and you will still spend much of yourtime at the board doing proofs.  I will not be lecturing on the material.<p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:efriedma@stetson.edu">erich.friedman@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.   My office phone is x7552.  My office hours this semester are:<p><ul><ul><li>Monday 3:30 - 4:30<br><li>Tuesday  2:00 - 3:00<br><li>Wednesday  10:00 - 11:00<br><li>Friday  10:00 - 11:00<p></ul></ul>I am always in my office during these times.  If you cannot make my regularlyscheduled hours, let me know and we can set up another time to talk. Please come byif you need help, or if you just want to chat.<H3>About you:  </H3>You should have passed MS 401.  The content of MS 201, MS 202, andMS 255 will also help, as you will be proving things about differentiation andintegration all semester. If you fall behind later, come see me as soon as possible.<H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> consists of written proofs of certainproblems in the notes.  Homework can be submitted anytime we are still studying thattopic, and will be graded and returned promptly. Each problem may be resubmitted ifnot satisfactory. You are not to use any outside source (except me) for these homeworkproblems.  Homework is designed to reinforce certain concepts, and make sure you cando proofs on your own. Homework is worth 1/5 of your grade.<p><b>Class participation</b>is very important.  You are expectedto come to every class with something to present.  You are encouraged to discussnon-homework problems with others both in and outside of class.  Writing proofs, explaining them, and critiquing another's proof are the major components of thiscourse.  If you do this well, the exams will be much easier. Class participation isworth 1/5 of your grade.<p><b>Oral exams</b> are to be scheduled with me as we finishdifferentiation and integration.  Don't be afraid of these exams.  As the class issmall, they are the best way for me to find out what you have learned from theclass.  These exams are each worth 1/5 of your grade.<p><b>The Final Exam</b> will be written.  Since the connectionsbetween chapters are as important as the chapters themselves, the final exam willcover material from both MS 401 and MS 402 (limits, continuity, differentiation, andintegration).  This exam is worth the remaining 1/5 of your grade.
