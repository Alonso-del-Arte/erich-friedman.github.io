<title>Complex Analysis</title><BODY background="chalk.jpg"><center><H1>MS 411 - Complex Analysis</H1></center><center><H2>Professor: Erich Friedman</H2></center><H3>About the course: </H3> We will meet MWF at 11:00 in Elizabeth 318.  This course will covermaterial from chapters 1-7 of the text, <i>Fundamentals of Complex Analysis</i> by Saff andSnider.  Topics of the course include complex numbers, complex functions, differentiationand integration of complex functions, series expansions of complex functions, and twoapplications: solving hard integrals of real functions, and solving steady state problemsin physics. <p><H3>About me:  </H3> My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:efriedma@stetson.edu">efriedma@stetson.edu</a>.  My web page can be found at <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/" >http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/</a>.   My office phone is x7552.  My office hours this semester are Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00 -- 11:00 and 2:00 -- 3:00.  Since this is my only course this semester, I'll be available a lot outside of class.<H3>About you:  </H3>You should have credit for MS201 and MS202.  It will certainly help ifyou have taken MS203 and MS255.  The calculus courses are needed since we will begeneralizing what you know about the calculus of real functions to complex functions.  Theresults are similar but are sometimes surprising.  The proof course will help since much ofthis course will involve proving the results that we find.  Some knowledge from MS401might also be useful.  You should be respectful of both me and your classmates.  This meanscoming to class on time and not socializing in class.  <H3>About your grade:</H3><b>Homework</b> will be collected every day, and I will grade a fewproblems from each set.  Homework is due in class,and I DO NOT accept late homework.  Feel free to work together on the homework problems, butplease write up your homework separately.  Copying homework is a violation of Stetson'shonor code.  I will answer homework questions in class as time permits, usually the first 15minutes of class.    Make sure you ask about homework problems that you can't do.  If Idon't have time in class, please see me outside of class.   Each homework is worth 4points, so altogether the homeworks are worth 1/6 of your grade.<p><b>Quizzes</b> will be given after chapters 1, 3, and 5, asindicated on the syllabus.  They will cover only the most recent material, andwill be about half the period.  They are mostly for your feedback.  If you are doing poorlyon the quizzes, this should serve as a warning that you do not know the material as well asI want you to.  Do something about it before the test!  Each quiz is worth 33 points, soaltogether the quizzes are worth 1/6 of your grade.<p><b>Tests</b> will be given after chapters 2, 4, and 7, as indicated onthe syllabus.  They will cover material since the last test, and will take the entireperiod.  Each test is worth 1/6 of your grade.<p><b>The Oral Final Exam</b> will be 2 hours long, and should bescheduled for some time during finals week.  You should be prepared to work problems, giveproofs, or explain concepts from this course.  The final will be comprehensive, and will beworth 1/6 of your grade.
