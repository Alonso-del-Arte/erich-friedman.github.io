# erich-friedman.github.io

I forked Erich Friedman's repository strictly only for the What's Special About This Number? page. For Hacktoberfest 2020, I will only accept two kinds of pull requests:

* Pull requests pertaining to the numbers.html page, which are aimed at improving the presentation of that page on all devices (without changing the underlying content)
* Pull requests pertaining to best practices for repositories, such as excluding files that are specific to a particular operating system.

I make no guarantee whatsoever that Erich Friedman will even consider the changes you or I or anyone else proposes.
