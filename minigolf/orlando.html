<p>Congo River is conveniently located close to the interstate.  It is expensive, but offers a great mix of themes, and some truly diabolical holes.  Many of the holes have rolling greens, so golfers used to long straight shots will be challenged.  We played on a stormy day, and ended up playing the last 4 holes in the pouring rain, but they offered us free tickets for next time.  You can buy food to feed their pet gators, and they have an arcade as well.</table></table></center>

<p>Congo River has two courses, but only one was open when we went.  The holes were okay, a nice variety of themes, and some interesting variations, but nothing terribly original.  They sell fish and alligator food if you want to feed the critters.</table></table></center>

<p>Tiki Island features two courses, one easy and one hard.  I played the hard course and had one of my best rounds EVER, and was still 2 over par.  You can find all the usual themes there.  Many holes are located along a slant that made for some difficult putting.  There is a 19<sup>th</sup> hole that can win you a free game, but it's nearly impossible.  They also have a volcano that actually erupts.</table></table></center>

<p>Pirate's Cove is a great course, easily the best in Orlando.  The holes are interesting and well-maintained.  The holes are challenging, but it's just possible to get a hole-in-one.  When we visited, we saw a family of ducks with about a dozen babies, cute as can be.  There are also pirate stories along the course, an arcade, and a wishing well.</table></table></center>

<p>Hawaiian Rumble is nothing special.  The course is expensive and features two courses of bland holes.  There are flags in the holes, a nice touch but not enough to make me want to play there again.  Par is difficult to achieve, and I didn't get a single hole-in-one.  The best part is the cafe, bar, and Ben and Jerry's attached.  At least your stomach won't rumble.</table></table></center>

<p>Bonanza Golf is a dud.  Save your money and play elsewhere.  The holes are mostly straight shots and bends, with no creativity whatsoever.  The courses intertwine repeatedly, so it is easy to get lost.  And there is a gift shop attached.</table></table></center>

<p>Pirate's Cove is a pleasant course.  The holes are interesting, but possible to do well on after a little practice.  Hitting the ball the right speed is important on many holes which go up or down.  There is pirate trivia at many holes.  Our friendly attendant gave a token for a free game to the person with the lowest score!</table></table></center>

This course offers many Disney statuettes and rhyming instructions, but it is more than a kiddie course.  The holes require both a delicate touch and some accuracy.  A bit too many "hit it really hard and hope for the best" type of holes, but otherwise a great and enjoyable course.  This course is really crowded, so be prepared to wait half an hour for a tee time.<p><hr><p>

This course is easily the hardest course I have ever played.  On six holes I had to take the 6-stroke maximum!  The holes are long with much topography, and hardly any rims to keep the ball in play.  We saw lots of wildlife, including ducks and a rabbit.</table></table></center>

<p>Winter Summerland is a tourist trap.  Maybe the kids will enjoy seeing Santa and his elves, but the holes on these courses are pretty unremarkable.  There are 10 variations of a straight shot with one or more obstacles, and only a few interesting holes with timing gimmicks.  I did enjoy getting unexpectantly wet (I won't ruin it for you) and the South Pole hole, but found the course to be overpriced and bland as a whole.</table></table></center>
