<p>Par at Golf Safari is 2 on every hole, so the holes aren't very challenging, except for the rough bricks that can send balls in unpredictable directions.  There is a large practice area, but you won't need much practice for these.  There are large plastic animals for nice photo-ops, and the story of Tarzan in 18 installments.</table></table></center>

<p>This is the fourth Congo River course that I have played, and I am never disappointed with what I find.  It's a bit expensive, but there are a variety of themes, and the course is well-maintained.  There is also a treasure hunt for the kids.  It was really crowded when we went, so prepare to wait behind large groups.  I don't usually make a big deal about the music, but I love their African rhythms.</table></table></center>
