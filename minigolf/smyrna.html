<p>This is the most crowded mini-golf we know.  They have two courses, one medium and one hard.  The medium course is a fairly typical course in many respects.  The hard course is very challenging, with lots of bends and slopes that require just the right angle or speed.  But the variety was a little disappointing.</table></table></center>
