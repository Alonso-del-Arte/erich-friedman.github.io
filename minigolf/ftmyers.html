<p>Mike Greenwells might have been an okay course in its heyday, but now it is run down.  The holes are uninteresting - many straight shots and many simple obstacles.  On the one hole featuring pipes that the balls are supposed to travel through, there was a big hole in the ground to get to the broken pipe.  The wood bridges and stairs are rotting away.  One plus: there are 6 handicap accessible holes.  They also have batting cages, an arcade, and go karts.</table></table></center>

<p>Castle Golf is an extremely interesting course, but a hard one, especially for newcomers.  It is meticulously maintained - they were blowing it off just as we arrived - but you'll walk so much you'll feel like it was regular golf.  Located in an area not yet built up by strip malls, it is buggy at night.  And there are ducks who live on the course who you might have to shoo away, but you can buy duck food to feed them. Definitely worth playing if you're in the area.</table></table></center>

<p>Smuggler's Cove is an extremely busy course, but worth playing.  The course itself is well maintained, and contains some interesting holes.  In addition, their putters actually have metal heads, and each hole has hints for those who haven't played there before.  And my favorite, there is an optional 16 1/2<sup>th</sup> hole that contains 8 holes which gives you either -1 or 2 depending on whether you get a hole in 1.  They also have bunches of baby alligators, if you care for that sort of thing.</table></table></center>

<p>Jungle Golf is a good example of what Mini-Golf used to be: pure holes that need good direction and the right speed and not a lot of frills.  There is a nice variety of themes, but nothing that unusual.</table></table></center>

<p>This is one of the worst courses I have ever played.  Unknowledgeable staff, soggy scorecards, dying plants, poor upkeep, no originality.  There are no pars.  That's right, because victory comes from doing your best.  There is also a 5-stroke maximum, which is absurd when there is a hole with three layers, each leading to the next.  They also have go-karts, an arcade, and of all things a roller coaster, so the mini-golf was clearly an afterthought, and you should save your money.</table></table></center>

<p>There is not much on Lee Road except this facility, though there is no sign by the road.  This course was okay, though too many holes of the "go around the obstacle" variety.  The lack of shade was oppressive on the hot day we played.  They also offer a driving range, and one of two <a href="http://ALICOFAMILYGOLF.COM/about-afg/snag-friendly-golf/">SNAG</a> (Starting New At Golf) courses in the country.</table></table></center>
