<p>Congo River is an upscale place.  The holes are nicely groomed, and contain many African themes.  Many holes are challenging, but there are a lot of par 3 holes that are easy to birdie.  On some holes, it is all but impossible to avoid hitting the ball into a water trap.  They also offer an arcade and party room.</table></table></center>

<p>Hawaiian Falls, which evidently used to be called Kahunna Falls, offers two courses, one easier and one harder.  Some holes are interesting, not to mention downright challenging, but several are just twists and turns, and others are just straight shots with nice scenery.</table></table></center>

<p>This is by far my favorite course in the area.  There are a variety of truly interesting holes with nicely groomed greens.  Every hole also contains a biography of a famous pirate.  The holes are easy enough to get some holes-in-one, but challenging enough to expect some double bogies.  You get a free game for a hole-in-one on any of three holes.  A friendly attendant and a "play all day" special make this a mini-golf heaven.</table></table></center>

<p>Go-Kart City's main attraction is Go Karts, but they also have batting cages, an arcade, and a mini-golf course.  Most of the holes are not inspiring.  There are many variations of "something in the way" or "roll it down the hill and see how close you can get".  But every hole is par 2, so it is hard to beat par.</table></table></center>
