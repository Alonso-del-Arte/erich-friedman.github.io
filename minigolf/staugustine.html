<p>Bay Front Golf, Florida's oldest mini-golf course, is located within easy walking distance of the Old Town area.  It is very inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.  This is a bare bones course: lots of straight shots, simple bank shots, or simple ramps.  The holes have flags, but they didn't have any long putters.  A nice diversion from a touristy day, but not worth a special trip.</table></table></center>

<p>Anastasia Adventure Golf used to be called Whitebirds Family Fun Center, and used to be a nice course.  There were some interesting holes, but not the variety of themes that you see at some places.  There was lots of shade, which means a lot of leaves on the course.  The most interesting thing about the course is that the greens aren't all green: some are red or purple!</table></table></center>

<p>Fiesta Falls is a pleasant course.  We were the first ones there one morning, and we had the course to ourselves.  This course has a good variety of themes and well maintained greens.  We found making par incredibly difficult.  In fact, the 18<sup>th</sup> hole is the hardest par 2 I have ever seen.  Our balls got stuck in a tube on the 9<sup>th</sup> hole, but otherwise it was a great course.  There are also 8 waterfalls, and many ducks call this course home.</table></table></center>

<p>Adventure Landing is a tourist trap, complete with go-karts, batting cages, and arcade.  The mini-golf is an afterthought, and I wasn't impressed.  Most holes were incredibly boring.  Though some holes were challenging, they were all par 2.  I'm a pretty good putter but I ended up 14 over par.  I would save your money and play the other St. Augustine courses.</table></table></center>
