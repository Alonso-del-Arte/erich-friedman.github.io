<p>This is a beautiful course overlooking Charlotte Harbor.  The course had too many boring holes with some topography for my taste, though that meant the course was one of the hardest I've ever played.  Of course we asked to play the more challenging of the two courses - perhaps mere mortals could succeed on the other course.  My favorite part of the course was the rare African lizard we saw while playing.  Come for the views, and don't keep score.</table></table></center>
