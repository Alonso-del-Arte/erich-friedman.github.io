Almost squares 1 &times; 2, 2 &times; 3, 3 &times; 4, . . . n &times; (n+1) can be tiled inside another almost square when n = 1, 3, 8, and 20, as the pictures below show.<p> <hr><p><TABLE BORDER=0 cellspacing=20 align=center><TR align=center><TD><img src="al1.gif"><br><font size=+2>n=1<TD><img src="al3.gif"><br><font size=+2>n=3<TD><img src="al8.gif"><br><font size=+2>n=8<TD><img src="al20.gif"><br><font size=+2>n=20</TR></TABLE>In January of 2012, I heard from Daan van den Berg that he and his students Florian
Braam, Mark Moes, and Emiel Suilen, had found a solution for n=34, the only other possible case.  They also sent me this <a href="http://www.heuristieken.nl/resources/2016Braametal-AlmostSquares.pdf">link</a> to their paper.<p>

In February of 2013, Giovanni Resta sent me the tiling below, which he says he found in January of 2007.  The widths are given, and the + or &ndash; sign indicates whether the height is 1 larger or smaller.<p>
