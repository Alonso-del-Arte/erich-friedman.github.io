His best r is the positive root of the equation  1 + r = r<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>3</sup> + r<sup>5</sup> + r<sup>9</sup> , or r = .828+.<p><center><img src="geomtri.gif"></center><p>For hexagons, I think the answer is r = .807+.<p><center><img src="geomhex.gif"></center><p>Another interesting variant is to pack 1 polygon of side r<sup>1</sup>, 2 polygonsof side r<sup>2</sup>, 3 polygons of side r<sup>3</sup>, and so on.  In this case, thelargest r value for both the square and triangle is &phi;=(&radic;(5)-1)/2, and there is no wasted space at all!<p><center><img src="phisq.gif"></center><p><center><img src="phitri.gif"></center><p><HR>
