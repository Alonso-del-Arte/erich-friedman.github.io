The answer is yes, and one possible packing is shown below.<p><CENTER><img src="harmsq.gif"></CENTER><p>For convenience, we have labelled a square  n  if it has side length  1/n . Similarly, we will call it square  n  in what follows.  The positions of all thelarger squares are shown.  Squares 24, 25, . . . 47  are arranged in a row. Squares 48, 49, . . . 95 are arranged in a row above that, and so on. <p>The same sort of packing can be done for triangles.<p><CENTER><img src="harmtri.gif"></CENTER><p>We can also do it for hexagons.  The triangles stand for an infinite regress of hexagons.  For example, the triangle labelled 5 contains hexagons (5), (15, 16, 17), (45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53), and so on.<p><CENTER><img src="harmhex.gif"></CENTER><p><HR></BODY></HTML>
