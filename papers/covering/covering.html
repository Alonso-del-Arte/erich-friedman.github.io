<font size=+2>Introduction</font><p>
The problem of covering squares with congruent squares has been around a long time.  In 1931, Dudeney published a problem [1] in which a square table of area &phi; <img src="approx.gif"> 1.618 was to be covered with 3 square tablecloths of area 1.  The solution is shown below in Figure 1.<p><center><img src="fig1.gif"></center><center>Figure 1.  Optimal covering with 3 squares</center><p>Alexander Soifer [5], [6] considered the problem of finding the smallest number of unit squares that can cover a square of side n+&epsilon;.  We consider the dual problem of finding the side s(n) of the largest square that can be covered with n unit squares.<p>

From area considerations, it is trivial that s(n) &le; &radic;n, and from s(n<sup>2</sup>) = n and monotonicity we have s(n) &ge; <img src="lfloor.gif" align=abscenter>n<img src="rfloor.gif" align=abscenter>.  When the decimal part of &radic;n is smaller than 1/2, this is the best known lower bound.  Thus we only consider n where the decimal part of &radic;n is at least 1/2.  (This is similar to the corresponding packing problem of packing n unit squares inside the smallest square [2].  When n is small and the decimal part of &radic;n is larger than 1/2, the optimal packings seem to be trivial.)  <p>

These best-known coverings seem to fall into 4 groups: <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I) a large square in the lower left corner, with additional squares covering the bent strip along the upper and right hand edges.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
II) two triangular "staircases" of squares in the lower left and upper right corners, with additional squares covering the main diagonal.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
III) four triangular "staircases" of squares in the corners, with a large square "diamond" covering the center.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IV) compound coverings made by overlapping smaller best-known coverings.<p>
     
We exhibit examples of each of these.  Coverings not attributed to someone else were discovered by the second author.<p>



<font size=+2>Examples</font><p>

When n = k<sup>2</sup>-1, the best-known covering is usually in group I, as shown in Figure 2.  The covering in Figure 1 is also in this series.  The first two coverings in Figure 2 are due to David Cantrell.<p>

Best-known coverings with 15, 24, and 35 squares (Type I)</center><p>Also, when n = k<sup>2</sup>-2, the best-known covering usually belongs (loosely) to group I, as shown in Figure 3. These were discovered by Trevor Green, Michael Kearney, and David Cantrell respectively.<p>

When k<sup>2</sup> - k &lt; n &lt; k<sup>2</sup>-2, the best-known covering is often in group II, as shown in Figure 4.  The first was discovered by David Cantrell.<p>

Certain values of n lend themselves to a better covering in group III, as shown in Figure 5.  The first was discovered by Trevor Green.<p>

<center><img src="fig5.gif"></center><center>Figure 5.  Best-known coverings with 8, 13, and 21 squares (Type III)</center><p>
Still other values of n lend themselves to a compound covering in group IV, as shown in Figure 6.  These examples illustrate the general theorem that s(2n+2m) &ge; s(n)+s(m).<p>

The non-trivial conjectured values of s(n) are given in Table 1.  A graph of the conjectured values of s(n)<sup>2</sup> is given in Figure 7.

<font size=+2>Proofs</font><p>

To show that s(2)=1, assume 2 squares can cover a larger square S.  Then both squares must cover exactly two corners of S.  Any square that covers the two left (or right) corners of S can cover no more than length 2&radic;2-1 &lt; 1 of the horizontal edges of S, a contradiction.  The proofs of s(5)=2 and s(10)=3 are similar. <img src="end.gif"><p>

To show that s(3)=&radic;((&radic;5+1)/2), assume 3 squares can cover a larger square S.  We first show that each square covers a corner of S.  Any square that covers the two left (or right) corners of S can cover no more than length 1/3 of a horizontal edge of S, so if two squares together cover all the corners, this leaves at least length 1/2 uncovered along two opposite sides of S, which a third square cannot cover.  Thus each square covers a corner of S, and at least one square covers two corners.<p>

We can assume each square is translated and rotated so as to cover as much of the perimeter of S as possible, and that a square T covers the top two corners.  This only leaves one degree of freedom: the length R of the right side of S covered by T, as in Figure 8.  It is easy to verify that the side of S is largest when R=0, which leads to the covering in Figure 1. <img src="end.gif">

<font size=+2>Unsolved Questions</font><p>
1) Are the coverings presented here optimal?  The optimal covering is known only when n = 2, 3, 5, 10, and square n.<p>

2) What are the corresponding results for other shapes?  Melissen [4] has considered the case of circles covering circles, but little is known about other shapes.<p>

3) What are the results in higher dimensions?  Even the case of 4 cubes "covering" a cube is unsolved.<p>
