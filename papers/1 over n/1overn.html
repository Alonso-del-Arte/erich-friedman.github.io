The answer is yes, and one possible packing is shown below in Figure 1.<p><center><img src="fig1.gif"></center><center>Figure 1.</center><p>For convenience, we have labelled a square n if it has side length 1/n. Similarly, we will call it square n in what follows.  The positions of all thelarger squares are shown.  Squares 24, 25, . . . 47  are arranged in a row. Squares 48, 49, . . . 95 are arranged in a row above that, and so on.  Thesesquares all fit vertically since<p><center>1/2+1/4+(1/24+1/48+1/96+ . . . ) = 5/6.</center><p>These squares all fit horizontally since the longest row is the bottom one, and <p><center>1/24+1/25+ . . . +1/47 <img src="approx.gif"> .703 &lt; 5/6.</center><p>The 5/6 by 5/6 square is the smallest that the squares of sides 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, . . . will fit into, because of the largest two squares.<p>A generalization of this problem is to attempt to pack regular polygons withsides 1/n into a similar polygon with side 5/6.  For which polygons can this bedone?  Such a packing of equilateral triangles is shown in Figure 2.<p><center><img src="fig2.gif"></center><center>Figure 2.</center><p>Here again, triangles 24, 25, . . . 47  are arranged in a row, triangles 48, 49, . . . 95 are arranged in a row above that, and so on.<p>A packing of regular hexagons of side 1/n into a regular hexagon of side 5/6 isshown in Figure 3.  The triangles in this diagram stand for an infinite regress ofhexagons that fit into that triangle.  For example, the larger hexagons containedin the triangle labelled 5 are shown in Figure 4.<p><center><img src="fig3.gif"></center><center>Figure 3.</center><p><center><img src="fig4.gif"></center><center>Figure 4.</center><p><h3>References</h3><p>[1] H.
