We also generalize this idea to other shapes, higher dimensions, and a more inclusive definition of "touching".<p><font size=+1><font size=+2>Squares</font><p>We call a finite, connected, non-overlapping collection of unit squares in the plane to be <i>n-touching</i> if each square touches exactly n other squares along some portion of an edge.   It is clear that n-touching collections exist for n = 0, 1, and 2 (see Figure 1).  It is also clear that 0-touching and 1-touching collections are limited in size to 1 and 2 squares respectively, whereas 2-touching collections can contain any number of squares that is at least 3.<p><center><img src="fig1.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 1.   0-touching, 1-touching, and 2-touching collections of squares</center><p>We exhibit a 3-touching collection of squares in Figure 2. <p><center><img src="fig2.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 2.  A 3-touching collection of 14 squares</center><p><b>Theorem: </b>3-touching collections containing k squares can only exist when k is even, and do exist for even k  &ge; 14.<p><b>proof: </b>That k must be even follows from the fact that the squares form the vertices of a 3-regular graph (where vertices are adjacent if the corresponding squares touch) and 3-regular graphs only exist with an even number of vertices.  We know there are 3-touching collections with 14, 16, and 18 squares (see Figures 2, 3, and 4 respectively).  We can insert an arbitrary number of columns of 6 squares (like the middle 6 squares in Figure 2) to extend these configurations into larger 3-touching collections of any larger even size.<p><b>Conjecture: </b>The 3-touching collection in Figure 2 is the smallest possible.<p><center><img src="fig2.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 3.  A 3-touching collection of 16 squares</center><p><center><img src="fig4.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 4.  A 3-touching collection of 18 squares</center><p><b>Theorem: </b>There are no 4-touching collections of squares.<p><b>proof: </b>Consider the leftmost square S in a 4-touching collection.  If there is a tie for the leftmost square, we let S be the highest of these.  There is no way for S to touch 4 other squares without another square being left or directly above S, a contradiction.<p>We mention in passing that there exist 4-touching collections of dominoes, as seen in Figure 5.<p><center><img src="fig5.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 5.  A 4-touching collection of 24 dominoes</center><p>We can also relax the definition of "touching" to include collections of squares that can touch at a single point (we call such collections <i>weakly n-touching</i>). There are weakly 4-touching collections of squares.  The smallest known consists of 50 squares and is shown in Figure 6.<p><b>Conjecture: </b>The weakly 4-touching collection in Figure 6 is the smallest possible.<p><center><img src="fig6.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 6.  A weakly  4-touching collection of 50 squares</center><p><font size=+2>Cubes</font><p>In 3 dimensions, we require each cube in an <i>n-touching</i> collection to touch exactly n other cubes along some portion of a face.  It is relatively easy to find a 5-touching collection of 6 cubes (see Figure 7).  The cubes are in two layers: a shaded layer on bottom and a slanted non-shaded layer on top.<p><center><img src="fig7.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 7.  A 5-touching collection of 6 cubes</center><p>We exhibit a 6-touching collection of 14 cubes in Figure 8.  Again the shaded squares are in a layer below the slanted unshaded squares.  The middle square in each case is moved slightly perpendicular to the paper to prevent more than 6 adjacencies.<p><center><img src="fig8.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 8. A 6-touching collection of 14 cubes</center><p><b>Conjecture: </b>There exists a 7-touching collection of cubes.<p><b>Theorem: </b>If there is an n-touching collection of hypercubes in dimension d, there is an (n+1)-touching collection of hypercubes in dimension (d+1).  If there is a weakly n-touching collection of hypercubes in dimension d, there is a weakly (2n+1)-touching collection of hypercubes in dimension (d+1).<p><b>proof: </b>By stacking two copies of the (possibily weakly) n-touching collection on top of each other in the (d+1)<sup>st</sup> dimension, we get such a collection with the required adjacencies.<p>This means there is a weakly 9-touching collection of cubes by imitating Figure 6.  It also means 3-touching collections with k cubes exist for all even k &ge; 4.<p><font size=+2>Open Questions</font><p>1. Is there a simple proof that there are no 3-touching collections of fewer than 14 squares?<p>2. For what k do there exist 4-touching, 5-touching, and 6-touching collections of cubes?  Does a 6-touching collection exist with fewer than 14 cubes?<p>3. Do there exist 7-touching collections of cubes?  How about weakly 10-touching collections of cubes?<p>4. What are the corresponding results for other polyominoes and other shapes?<p>5. What are the corresponding results for hypercubes in dimensions d &ge; 4?<p>
