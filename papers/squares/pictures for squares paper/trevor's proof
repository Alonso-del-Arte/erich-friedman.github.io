<b>Lemma 7. (Trevor Green)</b> If four unit squares are placed in a square of side s &lt; 3 insuch a way that each one covers one of the four points (1, 1), (s - 1, 1),(1, s - 1), (s - 1, s - 1), then there is at most onesquare whose center lies in [1, s - 1]<sup>2</sup>.<p>Proof: The center of such a square cannot lie within distance 1/2 of any ofthe four points.  However, the portion of [1, s - 1]<sup>2</sup> that does not liewithin 1/2 of any of the points lies within the circle of radius 1/2centred at (s/2, s/2).  Thus, any square whose center lies within[1, s - 1]^2 contains one of the four points orthe point (s/2, s/2).<img src="end.gif"><p><b>Lemma 8. (Trevor Green)</b> If a unit square is placed so that one of its vertices lieson the positive x-axis and another lies on the positive y-axis, thenit covers the line segment from (1, 1/3) to (1, 1)<sup>2</sup>.<p>Proof.  Lemma 1 shows that such a square will contain(1, 1), so we must show that it contains some point (1, y) with y<img src="le.gif">1/4.The vertex on the x-axis lies at (sin<img src="theta.gif">, 0),and rightmost vertex lies at (sin<img src="theta.gif">+cos<img src="theta.gif">, sin<imgsrc="theta.gif">).  The equation of the line joining them is y = tan<img src="theta.gif">(x -sin<img src="theta.gif">), and when x = 1, we have y = tan<img src="theta.gif"> - sec<imgsrc="theta.gif"> + cos<img src="theta.gif">.  This has a maximum of less than 1/3.<imgsrc="end.gif"><p><b>Theorem 8.</b>  s(6)=s(7)=3.<p>Proof: <img src="end.gif"><p>
