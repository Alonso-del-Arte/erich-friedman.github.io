Thus any non-overlapping collection of triangles which do not share vertices is 1-contained.  The smallest known k-contained sets of triangles for 2 &le; k &le; 5 are shown in Figures 1 and 2.<p>Are these the smallest k-contained collections possible?  Certainly for k = 2 and k = 3 they are, as can be easily verified by checking small cases.  We suspect they are optimal for k = 4 and  k = 5 as well, but do not have a proof.<p><center><img src="fig1.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 1.  2-contained (left) and 3-contained (right) triangles</center><p><center><img src="fig2.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 2.  4-contained (left) and 5-contained (right) triangles</center><p>There do not exist k-contained collections of triangles with k  larger than 5.  If there were, then the set of vertices and edges of the triangles would form a planar graph with every vertex having degree at least 6, which is impossible from Euler's Formula.<p>The triangles in the 2-contained set in Figure 1 are congruent.  The smallest known 3-contained set of congruent triangles is shown in Figure 3.  It is not known whether there is a 4-contained set of congruent triangles.<p><center><img src="fig3.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 3.

The smallest 2-contained and smallest known 3-contained sets of quadrilaterals are shown in Figure 4.  The quadrilaterals in the 2-contained set in Figure 4 are congruent.  It is unknown whether there is a 3-contained set of congruent quadrilaterals.<p><center><img src="fig4.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 4. 2-contained (left) and 3-contained (right) quadrilaterals</center><p>The smallest 2-contained and 3-contained sets of pentagons are shown in Figure 5.  Euler's Formula implies there are no 4-contained sets of quadrilaterals or pentagons.<p><center><img src="fig5.gif"></center><p><center>Figure 5.  2-contained (left) and 3-contained (right) pentagons</center><p>Euler's Formula also implies the only other k-contained sets of n-gons are when k = 2 and 6 &le; n &le; 10.  The planar realizations of a truncated tetrahedron, truncated cube, and truncated dodecahedron give 2-contained sets of n-gons for n = 6, 8, and 10 respectively.  To get 2-contained sets of 7-gons or 9-gons, we start with 2-contained sets of 8-gons or 10-gons respectively, and contract to points edges that connect pairs of polygons.  It is not known whether these give the smallest possible 2-contained sets.  <p><font size=+2>Open Questions</font><p>1. Are the k-contained sets of polygons presented here the smallest possible?<br>2. Does there exist a 4-contained set of congruent triangles, a 3-contained set of congruent quadrilaterals, or a 2-contained set of congruent pentagons?<br>3. How do these results change if we do not require the polygons to be convex?<br>4. What are the corresponding results in 3 dimensions?<p>
