He eventually took a degree in Canon Lawat the university of Ferrara. At Krakow, Bologna and Padua he studied the mathematical sciences.  At the time, these were considered relevant to medicine, since physicians made use of astrology. Padua was famous for its medical school and while he was there Copernicus studied both medicine and Greek.  When he returned to his native land, Copernicus practiced medicine, though his official employment was as a canon in the cathedral chapter.<p>While he was in Italy, Copernicus visited Rome, and it seems to have been for friends there that in about 1513 he wrote a short account of what has sincebecome known as the Copernican theory.  This states that the Sun, and not the Earth, is at rest in the centre of the Universe. A full account of the theory wasapparently slow to take a satisfactory shape, and was not published until the very end of Copernicus's life, under the title <i>On the revolutions of the heavenlyspheres</i>. Copernicus is said to have received a copy of the printed book for the first time on his deathbed.  He died of a cerebral hemorrhage. <p>Copernicus's heliostatic cosmology involved giving several distinct motions to the Earth. It was consequently considered implausible by the vast majority ofhis contemporaries, and by most astronomers and natural philosophers of succeeding generations before the middle of the seventeenth century. Its notabledefenders included Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. Strong theoretical underpinning for the Copernican theory was provided by Newton's theory of universal gravitation. </html>
