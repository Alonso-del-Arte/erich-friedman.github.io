His only brother went on to become Archbishop of Canterbury.<p>

Ramsey completed his secondary education at Winchester College in 1920, and won a scholarship to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and graduated in 1923.  After graduating, he was elected a fellow of King's College in Cambridge in 1924. He was only the second person ever to be elected to a fellowship at King's College who had not previously studied at King's.<p>

He was a quiet man, easy going and uninhibited.  He was a militant atheist, but his tolerance and good humor enabled him to disagree strongly without giving or taking offense.  He was 6'3" tall, bulky, and short-sighted. He only wrote in the mornings, preferring tennis, walking, or classical music in the evenings.<p>

He began as a lecturer in mathematics, but soon became Director of Studies in Mathematics.  Unfortunately, Ramsey died a few years later of jaundice at the age of 26.<p>

He published his first major mathematics paper, <i>The Foundations of Mathematics</i>, in 1925. His second and last mathematics paper, <i>On a problem of formal logic</i>, was published in 1930, and examined methods for determining the consistency of a logical formula.  But it also included some theorems on combinatorics which have led to the study of a whole new area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. This paper has stimulated an enormous study in both graph theory and in other branches of mathematics.<p>

Although Ramsey was a lecturer in mathematics, he also wrote on the foundations of mathematics, economics, and philosophy.  Ramsey was a close friend of John Maynard Keynes, the famous economist.  In economics, Ramsey wrote two papers <i>A contribution to the theory of taxation</i> and <i>A mathematical theory of saving</i>. These would lead to important new areas in the subject.  It was philosophy, however, that was Ramsey's real love. <p>
