His family had wanted him study law and indeed he startedto study this topic. However he soon discovered that it was not a subject that gave him satisfaction, and therefore took up the study of mathematics, astronomy and physics. <p>The teacher who influenced M&ouml;bius most during this time was Karl Mollweide, an astromomer famous mathematically for the Mollweide trigonometric relations and the Mollweide map in complex analysis.In 1813 M&ouml;bius travelled to G&ouml;ttingen where he studied astronomy under Gauss, the greatest mathematician of his day. In 1815 M&ouml;bius wrote his doctoral thesis on <i>The occultation of fixed stars</i>, and hisHabilitation thesis on <i>Trigonometrical equations</i>. He was appointed to the chair of astronomy and higher mechanics at the University of Leipzig in 1816. <p>However, M&ouml;bius did not receive quick promotion to full professor. It would appear that he was not a particularly good lecturer and this made his life difficultsince he did not attract fee paying students to his lectures. He was forced to advertise his lecture courses as being free of charge before students thought hiscourses worth taking.  By 1844 M&ouml;bius's reputation as a researcher led to an invitation from the University of Jena and at this stage the University of Leipzig gave him the FullProfessorship in astronomy which he clearly deserved.  <p>From the time of his first appointment at Leipzig M&ouml;bius had also held the post of Observer at the Observatory at Leipzig. He was involved the rebuilding ofthe Observatory and, from 1818 until 1821, he supervised the project.  In 1848 he became director of the Observatory. Although his most famous work is in mathematics, M&ouml;bius did publish important work on astronomy. He wrote a work concerning occultations of the planets. He also wrote on the principles of astronomy and on celestial mechanics. <p>M&ouml;bius's mathematical publications, although not always original, were effective and clear presentations.  Almost all his work was published in <i>Crelle's Journal</i>, the first journal devoted exclusively to publishing mathematics. His 1827 work on analytical geometry became a classic and includes many of his results on projective and affine geometry. In it he introducedhomogeneous coordinates and also discussed geometric transformations, in particular projective transformations. He introduced a configuration now called a M&ouml;bius net, which was to play an important role in the development of projective geometry. <p>M&ouml;bius's name is attached to many other important mathematical objects such as the M&ouml;bius function, the M&ouml;bius band, and the M&ouml;bius inversion formula. <p>In 1837 he published a work which gives a geometric treatment of statics. It led to the study of systems of lines in space. He considered a variant of the Four Color Problem in 1840 illustrating M&ouml;bius's interest in topological ideas, an area in which he is most rememberedas a pioneer. </html>
