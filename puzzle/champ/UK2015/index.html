<font size=+2>2. Rock-Scissors-Paper</font><p>

This puzzle is filled with rocks (fists), scissors (two fingers) and papers (palms). Your job is to start on a rock and visit each hex exactly once by jumping to a hex in the same row or sloping diagonal as the current hex. Each jump must follow the pattern rock &rarr; scissors &rarr; paper &rarr; rock, until you end on a rock. The jumps must never reverse direction, though you may jump over a hex multiple times.
