But that means A is Tweedledum, who will not be telling the truth day after tomorrow, a contradiction.<p>

Thus it is not Sunday, the only day on which Tweedledee could say what B did.<p>

Thus A is Tweedledee and B is Tweedledum.<p>

Today is the only day that Tweedledum could say what B did, Thursday.<p>
